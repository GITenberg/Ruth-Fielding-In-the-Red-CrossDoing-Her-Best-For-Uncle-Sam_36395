<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span>Ruth Fielding in the Red Cross</h1>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—UNCLE JABEZ IS EXCITED</h2>
<p>
“Oh! Not <em>Tom</em>?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding looked up from the box she was
packing for the local Red Cross chapter, and, almost
horrified, gazed into the black eyes of the
girl who confronted her.
</p>
<p>
Helen Cameron’s face was tragic in its expression.
She had been crying. The closely written
sheets of the letter in her hand were shaken, as
were her shoulders, with the sobs she tried to suppress.
</p>
<p>
“It—it’s written to father,” Helen said. “He
gave it to me to read. I wish Tom had never gone
to Harvard. Those boys there are completely
crazy! To think—at the end of his freshman
year—to throw it all up and go to a training
camp!”
</p>
<p>
“I guess Harvard isn’t to blame,” said Ruth
practically. If she was deeply moved by what her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
chum had told her, she quickly recovered her self-control.
“The boys are going from other colleges
all over the land. Is Tom going to try for
a commission?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What does your father say?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” cried the other girl as though that, too,
had surprised and hurt her, “father cried ‘Bully
for Tom!’ and then wiped his eyes on his handkerchief.
What can men be made of, Ruth? He
knows Tom may be killed, and yet he cheers for
him.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding smiled and suddenly hugged
Helen. Ruth’s smile was somewhat tremulous,
but her chum did not observe this fact.
</p>
<p>
“I understand how your father feels, dear.
Tom does not want to be drafted——”
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t be drafted. He is not old
enough. And even if they automatically draft
the boys as they become of age, it would be
months before they reached Tom, and the war
will be over by that time. But here he is throwing
himself away——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Helen! Not that!” cried Ruth. “Our
soldiers will fight for us—for their country—for
honor. And a man’s life lost in such a cause is
not thrown away.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the way I feel,” said Helen, more
steadily. “Tom is my twin. You don’t know what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
it means to have a twin brother, Ruth Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” sighed Ruth. “But I can imagine
how you feel, dear. If you have hopes of the
war’s being over so quickly, then I should expect
Tom back from training camp safe and sound,
and with no chance of ever facing the enemy. Has
he really gone?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” Helen told her despondently. “And
lots of the boys who used to go to school with Tom
at Seven Oaks. You know, all those jolly fellows
who were at Snow Camp with us, and at Lighthouse
Point, and on Cliff Island, and out West on
Silver Ranch—and—and everywhere. Just to
think! We may never see them again.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, Helen,” Ruth urged, “don’t look
upon the blackest side of the cloud. It’s a long
time before they go over there.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know how soon they will be in the
trenches,” said her friend hopelessly. “These
boys going to war——”
</p>
<p>
“And I wish I was young enough to go with
’em!” ejaculated a harsh voice, as the door of the
back kitchen opened and the speaker stamped into
the room. “Got that box ready to nail up, Niece
Ruth? Ben’s hitching up the mules, and I want
to get to Cheslow before dark.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Almost ready, Uncle Jabez,” cried the
girl of the Red Mill, as the gray old man approached.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
He was lean and wiry and the dust of his mill
seemed to have been so ground into his very skin
that he was a regular “dusty miller.” His features
were as harsh as his voice, and he was seldom
as excited as he seemed to be now.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s going to war now?” he asked, turning
to Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Poor—poor Tom!” burst out the black-eyed
girl, and began to dabble her eyes again.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter o’ him?” demanded the old
miller.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll—he’ll be shot—I know he’ll be killed,
and mangled horribly!”
</p>
<p>
“Fiddle-de-dee!” grunted Uncle Jabez, but his
tone of voice was not as harsh as his words
sounded. “I never got shot, nor mangled none
to speak of, and I was fightin’ and marchin’ three
endurin’ years.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>You</em>, Uncle Jabez?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. And I wish they’d take me again. I
can go a-soldierin’ as good as the next one. I’m
tough and I’m wiry. They talk about this war
bein’ a dreadful war. Shucks! All wars air
dreadful. They won’t never have a battle over
there that’ll be as bad as the Wilderness—believe
me! They may have more battles, but I went
through some of the wust a man could ever experience.”
</p>
<p>
“And—and you weren’t shot?” gasped Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit. Three years of campaigning and
never was scratched. Don’t you look for Tom
Cameron to be killed fust thing just because he’s
going to the wars. If more men didn’t come back
from the wars than git killed in ’em how d’ye
s’pose this old world would have gone on rolling?
Shucks!”
</p>
<p>
“I never knew you were a soldier, Uncle Jabez,”
Ruth Fielding said.
</p>
<p>
“Wal, I was. Shucks! I was something of a
sharpshooter, too. And we old fellers—course
I was nothin’ but a boy, <em>then</em>—we could shoot.
We’d l’arn’t to shoot on the farm. Powder an’
shot was hard to git and we l’arn’t to make every
bullet count. My old Betsey—didn’t ye ever see
my Civil War rifle?” he demanded of Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“You mean the old brown gun that hangs over
your bed and that Aunt Alvirah is so much afraid
of?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s old Betsey. Sharpe’s rifle. In them
days it was jest about the last thing in weepons.
I brung it home after the Grand Army of the Potomac
was disbanded. Know how I did it? Government
claimed all the guns; but I took old Betsey
apart and me an’ my mates hid the pieces away in
our clothes, and so got her home. Then I assembled
her again,” and Uncle Jabez broke into
a chuckle that was actually almost startling to the
girls, for the miller seldom laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say!” he exclaimed, in his strange excitement.
“I’ll show her to ye.”
</p>
<p>
He hurried out of the room, evidently in search
of “Old Betsey.” Helen said to the miller’s
niece:
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Ruth! what has happened to your
Uncle Jabez?”
</p>
<p>
“Just what has happened to Tom—and your
father,” returned the girl of the Red Mill. “I’ve
seen it coming on. Uncle Jabez has been getting
more and more excited ever since war was declared.
You know, when we came home from college
a month ago and decided to remain here and
help in the Red Cross work instead of finishing
our sophomore year at Ardmore, my decision was
really the first one I ever made that Uncle Jabez
seemed to approve of immediately.
</p>
<p>
“He is thoroughly patriotic. When I told him
I could study later—when the war was over—but
that I must work for the soldiers now, he said
I was a good girl. What do you think of <em>that</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Cheslow is not doing its share,” Helen said
thoughtfully, her mind switched by Ruth’s last
words to the matter that had completely filled her
own and her chum’s thoughts for weeks. “The
people are not awake. They do not know we are
at war yet. They have not done half for the Red
Cross that they should do.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll make ’em!” declared Ruth Fielding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
“We must get the women and girls to pull together.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, Ruth! what do you think of that woman
in black—you know, the widow, or whoever she
is? Dresses in black altogether; but maybe it’s
because she thinks black becomes her,” added
Helen rather scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Mantel?” asked Ruth slowly. “I don’t
know what to think of her. She seems to be very
anxious to help. Yet she does nothing really
helpful—only talks.”
</p>
<p>
“And some of her talk I’d rather not hear,”
said Helen sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I know what you mean,” Ruth rejoined, nodding.
“But so many people talk so doubtfully.
They are unfamiliar with the history of the Red
Cross and what it has done. Perhaps Mrs. Mantel
means no harm.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment Uncle Jabez reappeared with
the heavy rifle in his hands. He was still chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“Calc’late I ain’t heard Aunt Alvirah talk about
this gun much of late. One spell—when fust she
come here to the Red Mill to keep house for me—she
didn’t scurce dare to go into my room because
of it. But, of course, ‘twarn’t ever loaded.
</p>
<p>
“I was some sharpshooter, gals,” he added
proudly, patting the stock of the heavy gun.
“Here’s a ca’tridge. I’m goin’ to stick it in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
an’ you shall hear how she roars. Warn’t no
Maxim silencers, nor nothin’ like that, when I
used to pot the Johnny Rebs with Old Betsey.”
</p>
<p>
He flung open the door into the back yard. He
raised the rifle to his shoulder, having slipped in
the greased cartridge.
</p>
<p>
“See that sassy jay atop o’ that cherry tree?
I bet I kin clutter him up a whole lot—an’ he desarves
it,” said Uncle Jabez.
</p>
<p>
Just then the door into the other kitchen
opened, and a little, crooked-backed old woman
with a shawl around her shoulders and a cap atop
of her thin hair appeared.
</p>
<p>
“Jabez Potter! What in creation you goin’ to
do with that awful gun?” she shrilled.
</p>
<p>
“I’m a-goin’ to knock the topknot off’n that
bluejay,” chuckled Uncle Jabez.
</p>
<p>
“Stop! Don’t! Gals!” cried the little old
woman, hobbling down the two steps into the
room. “Oh, my back! and oh, my bones! Gals!
stop him! That gun can’t shoot ’cause I went and
plugged the barrel!”
</p>
<p>
At that moment Old Betsey went off with an
awful roar.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—THE CALL OF THE DRUM</h2>
<p>
There was a flash following the explosion, and
Uncle Jabez staggered back from the doorway,
his arm across his eyes, while the gun dropped
with a crash to the porch. The girls, as well as
Aunt Alvirah, shrieked.
</p>
<p>
“I vum!” ejaculated the miller. “Who done
that? What’s happened to Old Betsey?”
</p>
<p>
“Jabez Potter!” shrilled the little old woman,
“didn’t I tell you to git rid o’ that gun long ago?
Be you shot?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the miller grimly. “I’m only
scare’t. Old Betsey never kicked like that afore.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was at his side patting his shoulder and
looking at him anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Shucks!” scoffed the miller. “I ain’t dead yit.
But what made that gun——”
</p>
<p>
He stooped and picked it up. First he looked
at the twisted hammer, then he turned it around
and looked into the muzzle.
</p>
<p>
“For the good land o’ liberty!” he yelled.
“What’s the meanin’ of this? Who—who’s gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
and stuck up this here gun bar’l this a-way? I
vum! It’s <em>ce</em>-ment—sure’s I’m a foot high.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you want to tetch that gun for, Jabez
Potter?” demanded Aunt Alvirah, easing herself
into a low rocker. “Oh, my back! and oh,
my bones! I allus warned you ‘twould do some
harm some day. That’s why I plugged it up.”
</p>
<p>
“You—you plugged it up?” gasped the miller.
“Wha—what for I want to know?”
</p>
<p>
“So, if ’twas loaded, no bullet would get out
and hurt anybody,” declared the little old woman
promptly. “Now, you kin get mad and use bad
language, Jabez Potter, if you’ve a mind to. But
I’d ruther go back to the poorhouse to live than
stay under this ruff with that gun all ready to shoot
with.”
</p>
<p>
The miller was so thunderstruck for a moment
that he could not reply. Ruth feared he might fly
into a temper, for he was not a patient man. But,
oddly enough, he never raged at the little old
housekeeper.
</p>
<p>
“I vum!” he said at last. “Don’t that beat all?
An’ ain’t it like a woman? Stickin’ up the muzzle
of the gun so’s it couldn’t shoot—but <em>would</em> explode.
Shucks!” He suddenly flung up both
hands. “Can you beat ’em? <em>You can’t!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Now that it was all over, and the accident had
not caused any fatality, the two girls felt like
laughing—a hysterical feeling perhaps. They got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
Aunt Alvirah into the larger kitchen and left
Uncle Jabez to nail up the box that he was going
to ship for Ruth to Red Cross headquarters.
</p>
<p>
The girl of the Red Mill had been gathering
the knitted wear and comfort kits from the neighbors
around to send on to the Red Cross headquarters,
and, in the immediate vicinity of the
Red Mill, she knew that the women and girls were
doing a better work for the cause than in Cheslow
itself.
</p>
<p>
The mill and the rambling old house that adjoined
and belonged to Uncle Jabez Potter stood
upon the bank of the Lumano River, and was as
beautiful a spot as one might find in that part of
the state. Ruth Fielding had always loved it since
the first day her eyes had spied it, when as a little
girl she had come to live with her cross and
crotchety Uncle Jabez.
</p>
<p>
The miller was a miserly man, and, at first,
Ruth had had no pleasant time as a dependent
on her uncle. Had it not been for Aunt Alvirah
Boggs, who was nobody’s relative but everybody’s
aunt, and whom Uncle Jabez had taken from the
poorhouse to keep house for him, the lonely little
orphan girl would have been quite heartbroken.
</p>
<p>
With Aunt Alvirah’s help and the consolation
of her philosophy, as well as with the aid of the
friendship of Helen and Tom Cameron, who were
neighbors, Ruth Fielding began to be happy. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
really unhappy thereafter she never could be, for
something was always happening to her, and the
active person is seldom if ever in the doldrums.
</p>
<p>
In the first volume of the series, “Ruth Fielding
of the Red Mill,” these and others of Ruth’s
friends were introduced, and the girl began to
develop that sturdy and independent character
which has made her loved by so many. With
Helen she went to Briarwood Hall to boarding
school, and there her acquaintance rapidly widened.
For some years her course is traced through
several volumes, at school and during vacations at
different places where exciting and most delightful
adventures happen to Ruth and her friends.
</p>
<p>
In following volumes we meet Ruth Fielding
at Snow Camp, at Lighthouse Point, at Silver
Ranch, on Cliff Island, at Sunrise Farm, in a
Gypsy camp, in Moving Pictures, down in Dixie,
and, finally, she graduates from Briarwood Hall,
and she and her chums enter Ardmore College.
At the beginning of this, the thirteenth volume of
the series, Ruth and Helen were quite grown up.
Following their first year at Ardmore, Ruth had
gone West to write and develop a moving picture
for the Alectrion Film Corporation, in which she
now owned an interest.
</p>
<p>
In “Ruth Fielding in the Saddle; or, College
Girls in the Land of Gold,” an account of this adventure
is narrated, the trip occupying most of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
the first summer following Ruth’s freshman year.
Ruth’s success as a writer of moving-picture scenarios
of the better class had already become established.
“The Forty-Niners” had become one
of the most successful of the big scenarios shown
during the winter just previous to the opening of
our present story.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had made much money. Together with
what she had made in selling a claim she had
staked out at Freezeout, where the pictures were
taken, her bank accounts and investments now ran
well into five figures. She really did not want
Uncle Jabez to know exactly how much she had
made and had saved. Mr. Cameron, Helen’s
father, had her finances in charge, although the
girl of the Red Mill was quite old enough, and
quite wise enough, to attend to her own affairs.
</p>
<p>
Interest in Red Cross work had smitten Ruth
and Helen and many of their associates at college.
Not alone had the men’s colleges become markedly
empty during that previous winter; but the
girls’ schools and colleges were buzzing with excitement
regarding the war and war work.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Congress declared a state of war
with Germany, Ruth and Helen had hurried home.
Cheslow, the nearest town, was an insular community,
and many of the people in it were hard to
awaken to the needs of the hour. Because of the
peaceful and satisfied life the people led they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
could not understand what war really meant.
</p>
<p>
Cheslow and the vicinity of the Red Mill was
not alone in this. Many, many communities were
yet to be awakened.
</p>
<p>
Ruth bore these facts very much on her heart.
She was doing all that she could to strike a note
of alarm that should awaken Cheslow.
</p>
<p>
Despite Uncle Jabez Potter’s patriotism, she
would have been afraid to tell him just how much
she had personally subscribed for the work of the
Red Cross and for other war activities. And,
likewise, in her heart was another secret—a longing
to be doing something of moment for the
cause. She wanted to really enlist for the war!
She wished she might be “over there” in body, as
well as in spirit.
</p>
<p>
Not only were the drums calling to Tom Cameron
and his friends, and many, many other boys,
but they were calling the girls to arms as well.
Never before has war so soon and so suddenly
offered womankind a chance to aid in an undying
cause.
</p>
<p>
Yet Ruth did not neglect the small and seemingly
unimportant duties right at hand. She was
no dreamer or dallier. Having got off this big
box of comforts for the boys at the front, the very
next day she, with Helen, took up the effort
already begun of a house-to-house campaign
throughout Cheslow for Red Cross members, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
to invite the feminine part of the community to
aid in a big drive for knitted goods.
</p>
<p>
The Ladies’ Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal
Church was meeting that day with Mrs.
Curtis, the wife of the railroad station agent and
the mother of one of Ruth’s friends at boarding
school. Mercy Curtis, having quite outgrown her
childish ills, welcomed the friends when they rang
the bell.
</p>
<p>
“Do come in and help me bear the chatter of
this flock of starlings,” Mercy said. “Glad to see
you, girlies!” and she kissed both Ruth and Helen.
</p>
<p>
“But I am afraid I want to join the starlings,
as you call them,” Ruth said demurely; “and even
add to their chatter. I came here for just that
purpose.”
</p>
<p>
“For just what purpose?” Mercy demanded.
</p>
<p>
“To talk to them. I knew the crowd would be
here, and so I thought I could kill two birds with
one stone.”
</p>
<p>
“Two birds, only?” sniffed Mercy. “Kill ’em
all, for all I care! I’ll run and find you some
stones.”
</p>
<p>
“My ammunition are hard words only,”
laughed Ruth. “I want to tell them that they are
not doing their share for the Red Cross.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Mercy. “Humph! Well,
Ruthie, you have come at an unseasonable time, I
fear. Mrs. Mantel is here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Mantel!” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“The woman in black!” exclaimed Helen.
“Well, Mercy, what has she been saying?”
</p>
<p>
“Enough, I think,” the other girl replied. “At
least, I have an idea that most of the women in
the Ladies’ Aid believe that it is better to go on
with the usual sewing and foreign and domestic
mission work, and let the Red Cross strictly
alone.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—THE WOMAN IN BLACK</h2>
<p>
“Do you mean to say,” demanded Helen Cameron,
with some anger, “that they have no interest
in the war, or in our boys who will soon begin to
go over there? Impossible!”
</p>
<p>
“I repeat that,” said Ruth. “‘Impossible,’ indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, each may knit for her own kin or for other
organizations,” Mercy said. “I am repeating
what I have just heard, that is all. Girls! I am
just boiling!”
</p>
<p>
“I can imagine it,” Helen said. “I am beginning
to simmer myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait. Let us be calm,” urged Ruth, smiling
as she laid off her things, preparatory to going
into the large front room where Mrs. Curtis was
entertaining the Ladies’ Aid Society.
</p>
<p>
“Is it all because of that woman in black?” demanded
Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she has been pointing out that the Red
Cross is a great money-making scheme, and that
it really doesn’t need our small contributions.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“And she is a member herself!” snapped Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she joined, of course, because she did
not want anybody to think she wasn’t patriotic,”
scoffed Mercy. “That is the way she puts it. But
you ought to hear the stories she has been telling
these poor, simple women.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever!” cried Helen angrily.
</p>
<p>
“It is well we came here,” Ruth said firmly.
“Let me into the lions’ den, Mercy.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid they are another breed of cats.
There is little noble or lionlike about some of
them.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Helen were quite used to Mercy
Curtis’ sharp tongue. It was well known. But it
was evident, too, that the girl had been roused
to fury by what she had heard at the meeting of
the Ladies’ Aid Society.
</p>
<p>
The ladies of the church society were, for the
most part, very good people indeed. But at this
time the war was by no means popular in Cheslow
(as it was not in many places) and the plague of
pacifism, if not actually downright pro-German
propaganda, was active and malignant.
</p>
<p>
When the door into the big front room was
opened and the girls entered, Mrs. Curtis rose
hastily to welcome Ruth and Helen warmly. The
women were, for the most part, busily sewing.
But, of course, that puts no brake upon the activities
of the tongue. Indeed, the needle seems to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
particularly helpful as an accompaniment to a
“dish of gossip.”
</p>
<p>
“I still think it is terrible,” one woman was saying
quite earnestly to another, who was one of the
few idle women in the room, “if an organization
like that cannot be trusted.”
</p>
<p>
The idle woman was dressed plainly but elegantly
in black, with just a touch of white at wrists
and throat. She was a graceful woman, tall, not
yet forty, and with a set smile on her face that
might have been the outward sign of a sweet temperament,
and then——
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Mantel!” whispered Helen to Ruth. “I
do not like her one bit. And nobody knows where
she came from or who she is. Cheslow has only
been her abiding place since we went to college
last autumn.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” whispered Ruth in return. “I am interested.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I assure you, my dear Mrs. Crothers,
that it may not be the organization’s fault,”
purred the woman in black. “The objects of the
Red Cross are very worthy. None more so. But
in certain places—locally, you know—of course I
don’t mean here in Cheslow——
</p>
<p>
“Yet I could tell you of something that happened
to me to-day. I was quite hurt—quite
shocked, indeed. I saw on the street a sweater
that I knitted myself last winter.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! On a soldier?” asked another of the
women who heard. “How nice!”
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed. No soldier,” said Mrs. Mantel
quickly. “On a girl. Fancy! On a girl I had
never seen before. And I gave that to the Red
Cross with my own hands.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it belonged to the girl’s brother,” another
of the women observed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” Mrs. Mantel was eager to say. “I
asked her. Naturally I was curious—very curious.
I said to her, ‘Where did you get the
sweater, my girl, if you will pardon my asking?’
And she told me she bought it in a store here in
Cheslow.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped another of the group.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to say the Red Cross sells the
things people knit for them?” cried Mrs. Crothers.
</p>
<p>
“How horrid!” drawled another. “Well, you
never can tell about these charitable organizations
that are not connected with the church.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding broke her silence and quite calmly
asked:
</p>
<p>
“Will you tell me who the girl was and where
she said she bought the sweater, Mrs. Mantel?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I never saw the girl before,” said the lady
in black.
</p>
<p>
“But she told you the name of the store where
she said she purchased it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“No-o. What does it matter? I recognized
my own sweater!” exclaimed the woman in black,
with a toss of her head.
</p>
<p>
“Are you quite sure, Mrs. Mantel,” pursued the
girl of the Red Mill insistently but quite calmly,
“that you could not have made a mistake?”
</p>
<p>
“Mistake? How?” snapped the other.
</p>
<p>
“Regarding the identity of the sweater.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I recognized it. I know I knitted
it. I certainly know my own work. And why
should I be cross-questioned, please?”
</p>
<p>
“My name is Ruth Fielding,” Ruth explained.
“I happen to have at present a very deep interest
in the Red Cross work—especially in our local
chapter. Did you give your sweater to our local
chapter?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—no. But what does that matter?” and
the woman in black began to show anger. “Do
you doubt my word?”
</p>
<p>
“You offer no corroborative evidence, and you
make a very serious charge,” Ruth said. “Don’t
be angry. If what you say is true, it is a terrible
thing. Of course, there may be people using the
name of the Red Cross who are neither patriotic
nor honest. Let us run each of these seemingly
wicked things down—if it is possible. Let us get
at the truth.”
</p>
<p>
“I have told you the truth, Miss Fielding. And
I consider you insulting—most unladylike.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Mantel,” said Ruth Fielding gravely,
“whether I speak and act as a lady should make
little material difference in the long run. But
whether a great organization, which is working
for the amelioration of suffering on the battle
front and in our training camps, is maligned, is
of very great moment, indeed.
</p>
<p>
“In my presence no such statement as you have
just made can go unchallenged. You must help
me prove, or disprove it. We must find the girl
and discover just how she came by the sweater.
If it had been stolen and given to her she would
be very likely to tell you just what you say she
did. But that does not prove the truth of her
statement.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor of mine, I suppose you would say!” cried
Mrs. Mantel.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. If you are fair-minded at all you
will aid me in this investigation. For I purpose
to take up every such calumny that I can and trace
it to its source.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth, don’t take it so seriously!” Mrs.
Curtis murmured, and most of the women looked
their displeasure. But Helen clapped her hands
softly, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Bully for you, Ruthie!”
</p>
<p>
Mercy’s eyes glowed with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
Ruth became silent for a moment, for the
woman in black evidently intended to give her no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
satisfaction. Mrs. Mantel continued to state,
however, for all to hear:
</p>
<p>
“I certainly know my own knitting, and my own
yarn. I have knitted enough of the sweaters
according to the Red Cross pattern to sink a ship!
I would know one of my sweaters half a block
away at least.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had been watching the woman very keenly.
Mrs. Mantel’s hands were perfectly idle in her
lap. They were very white and very well cared
for. Ruth’s vision came gradually to a focus upon
those idle hands.
</p>
<p>
Then suddenly she turned to Mercy and whispered
a question. Mercy nodded, but looked
curiously at the girl of the Red Mill. When the
latter explained further Mercy Curtis’ eyes began
to snap. She nodded again and went out of
the room.
</p>
<p>
When she returned with a loosely wrapped
bundle in her hands she moved around to where
the woman in black was sitting. The conversation
had now become general, and all were trying
their best to get away from the previous topic of
tart discussion.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Mantel,” said Mercy very sweetly, “you
must know a lot about knitting sweaters, you’ve
made so many. Would you help me?”
</p>
<p>
“Help you do what, child?” asked the woman
in black, rather startled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am going to begin one,” explained Mercy,
“and I do wish, Mrs. Mantel, that you would
show me how. I’m dreadfully ignorant about the
whole thing, you know.”
</p>
<p>
There was a sudden silence all over the room.
Mrs. Mantel’s ready tongue seemed stayed. The
pallor of her face was apparent, as innocent-looking
Mercy, with the yarn and needles held
out to her, waited for an affirmative reply.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—“CAN A POILU LOVE A FAT GIRL?”</h2>
<p>
The shocked silence continued for no more than
a minute. Mrs. Mantel was a quick-witted
woman, if she was nothing else commendable.
But every member of the Ladies’ Aid Society
knew what Mercy Curtis’ question meant.
</p>
<p>
“My dear child,” said the woman in black,
smiling her set smile but rising promptly, “I
shall have to do that for you another day.
Really I haven’t the time just now to help you
start any knitting. But later——
</p>
<p>
“I am sure you will forgive me for running
away so early, Mrs. Curtis; but I have another
engagement. And,” she shot a malignant glance
at Ruth Fielding, “I am not used to being
taken to task upon any subject by these college-chits!”
</p>
<p>
She went out of the room in a manner that,
had she been thirty years younger, could have
been called “flounced”—head tossing and skirts
swishing with resentment. Several of the women
looked at the girl of the Red Mill askance, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
they dared not criticize Mercy Curtis, for
they knew her sharp tongue too well.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Pubsby,” Ruth said quietly to the pleasant-faced,
Quakerish-looking president of the society,
“may I say a word to the ladies?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you may, Ruthie,” said the good
woman comfortably. “I have known you ever
since you came to Jabez Potter’s, and I never
knew you to say a dishonest or unkind word. You
just get it off your mind. It’ll do you good, child—and
maybe do some of us good. I don’t know
but we’re—just a mite—getting religiously
selfish.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no idea of trying to urge you ladies to
give up any of your regular charities, or trying to
undermine your interest in them. I merely hope
you will broaden your interests enough to include
the Red Cross work before it is too late.”
</p>
<p>
“How too late?” asked Mrs. Crothers, rather
snappishly. She had evidently been both disturbed
and influenced by the woman in black.
</p>
<p>
“So that our boys—some of them your sons and
relatives—will not get over to France before the
Red Cross is ready to supply them with the comforts
they may need next winter. It is not impossible
that boys right from Cheslow will be over
there before cold weather.”
</p>
<p>
“The war will be over long before then,
Ruthie,” said Mrs. Pubsby complacently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard Dr. Cummings, the pastor, say
that he is told once in about so often that the devil
is dead,” Ruth said smiling. “But he is never
going to believe it until he can personally help
bury him. Our Government is going about this
war as though it might last five years. Are we
so much wiser than the men at the head of the
nation—even if we have the vote?” she added,
slyly.
</p>
<p>
“It does not matter whether the war will be
ended in a few weeks, or in ten years. We should
do our part in preparing for it. And the Red
Cross is doing great and good work—and has
been doing it for years and years. When people
like the lady who has just gone out repeat and
invent slanders against the Red Cross I must stand
up and deny them. At least, such scandal-mongers
should be made to prove their statements.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth Fielding! That is not a kind word,”
said Mrs. Crothers.
</p>
<p>
“Will you supply me with one that will satisfactorily
take its place?” asked Ruth sweetly. “I
do not wish to accuse Mrs. Mantel of actually
prevaricating; but I do claim the right of asking
her to prove her statements, and that she seems
to decline to do.
</p>
<p>
“And I shall challenge every person I meet who
utters such false and ridiculous stories about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
Red Cross. It is an out-and-out pro-German
propaganda.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mrs. Mantel is a member of the Red
Cross herself,” said Mrs. Crothers sharply.
</p>
<p>
“She evidently is not loyal to her pledge then,”
Ruth replied with bluntness. “The lady is not a
member of our local chapter, and I have failed
yet to hear of her being engaged in any activity
for the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
“But I want you ladies—all of you—to take
the Red Cross work to heart and to learn what
the insignia stands for.”
</p>
<p>
With that the earnest girl entered upon a brief
but moving appeal for members to the local chapter,
for funds, and for workers. As Helen said
afterward, Ruth’s “mouth was opened and she
spake with the tongues of angels!”
</p>
<p>
At least, her words did not go for naught.
Several dollar memberships were secured right
there and then. And Mrs. Brooks and Mary
Lardner promised a certain sum for the cause—both
generous gifts. Best of all, Mrs. Pubsby
said:
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about this being shown our duty
by this wisp of a girl. But, ladies, she’s right—I
can feel it. And I always go by my feelings,
whether it’s in protracted meetings or in my rheumatic
knee. I feel we must do our part.
</p>
<p>
“This gray woolen sock I’m knitting was for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
my Ezekiel. But my Ezey has got plenty socks.
From now on I’m going to knit ’em for those
poor soldiers who will like enough get their feet
wet ditching over there in France, and will want
plenty changes of socks.”
</p>
<p>
So Ruth started something that afternoon, and
she went on doing more and more. Cheslow began
to awake slowly. The local chapter rooms
began to hum with life for several hours every
day and away into the evening.
</p>
<p>
In the Cameron car, which Helen drove so
that a chauffeur could be relieved to go into the
army, the two girls drove all about the countryside,
interesting the scattered families in war work
and picking up the knitted goods made in the
farmhouses and villages.
</p>
<p>
In many places they had to combat the same
sort of talk that the woman in black was giving
forth. Ruth was patient, but very insistent that
the Red Cross deserved no such criticism.
</p>
<p>
“Come into Cheslow and see what we are doing
there at our local headquarters. I will take
you in and bring you back. I’ll take you to the
county headquarters at Robinsburg. You will
there hear men and women speak who know much
more than I do about the work.”
</p>
<p>
This was the way she pleaded for fairness and
public interest, and a ride in a fine automobile was
a temptation to many of the women and girls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
An afternoon in the rooms of a live Red Cross
chapter usually convinced and converted most of
these “Doubting Thomasines,” as Helen called
them.
</p>
<p>
Working with wool and other goods was all
right. But money was needed. A country-wide
drive was organized, and Ruth was proud that
she was appointed on the committee to conduct it.
Mr. Cameron, who was a wealthy department
store owner in the city, was made chairman of
this special committee, and he put much faith in
the ability of the girl of the Red Mill and his own
daughter to assist materially in the campaign for
funds.
</p>
<p>
“Get hold of every hardshell farmer in the
county,” he told the girls. “Begin with your
Uncle Jabez, Ruthie. If he leads with a goodly
sum many another old fellow who keeps his surplus
cash in a stocking or in the broken teapot
on the top cupboard shelf will come to time.
</p>
<p>
“The reason it is so hard to get contributions
out of men like Jabez Potter,” said Mr. Cameron
with a chuckle, “is because nine times out of ten
it means the giving up of actual money. They
have their cash hid away. It isn’t making them
a penny, but they like to hoard it, and some of
’em actually worship it.
</p>
<p>
“And not to be wondered at. It comes hard.
Their backs are bent and their fingers knotted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
from the toil of acquiring hard cash, dollar by
dollar and cent by cent. It is much easier to
write a check for a hundred dollars to give to a
good cause than it is to dig right down into one’s
jeans and haul out a ten-dollar note.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew just how hard this was going to be—to
interest the purses of the farming community
in the Red Cross drive. The farmers’ wives and
daughters were making their needles fly, but the
men merely considered the work something like
the usual yearly attempt to get funds out of them
for foreign missions.
</p>
<p>
“I tell ye what, Niece Ruth, I got my doubts,”
grumbled Uncle Jabez, when she broached the
subject of his giving generously to the cause. “I
dunno about so much money being needed for
what you’re callin’ the ‘waste of war’!”
</p>
<p>
“If you read those statistics, compiled under
the eyes of Government agents,” she told him,
“you must be convinced that it is already proved
by what has happened in France and Belgium—and
in other countries—during the three years of
war, that all this money will be needed, and
more.”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno. Millions! Them is a power of
dollars, Niece Ruth. You and lots of other folks
air too willing to spend money that other folks
have airned by the sweat of their brows.”
</p>
<p>
He offered her a sum that she was really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
ashamed to put down at the top of her subscription
paper. She went about her task in the hope
that Uncle Jabez’s purse and heart would both be
opened for the cause.
</p>
<p>
Not that he was not patriotic. He was willing—indeed
anxious—to go to the front and give
his body for the cause of liberty. But Uncle
Jabez seemed to love his dollars better than he
did his body.
</p>
<p>
“Give him time, dearie, give him time,” murmured
Aunt Alvirah, rocking back and forth in
her low chair. “The idea of giving up a dollar
to Jabez Potter’s mind is bigger than the shooting
of a thousand men. Poor boys! Poor boys!
How many of them may lack comforts and hospitals
while the niggard people like Jabez Potter
air wakin’ up?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s heart was very sore about the going
over of the American expeditionary forces at this
time, too. She said little to Helen about it, but
the fact that Tom Cameron—her very oldest
friend about the Red Mill and Cheslow—looked
forward to going at the first moment possible,
brought the war very close to the girl.
</p>
<p>
The feeling within her that she should go across
to France and actually help in some way grew
stronger and stronger as the days went by. Then
came a letter from Jennie Stone.
</p>
<p>
“Heavy,” as she had always been called in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
school and even in college, was such a fun-loving,
light-hearted girl that it quite shocked both Ruth
and Helen when they learned that she was already
in real work for the poor poilus and was
then about to sail for France.
</p>
<p>
Jennie Stone’s people were wealthy, and her
social acquaintances were, many of them, idle
women and girls. But the war had awakened
these drones, and with them the plump girl. An
association for the establishment and upkeep of
a convalescent home in France had been formed in
Jennie’s neighborhood, and Jennie, who had always
been fond of cooking—both in the making
of the dishes and the assimilation of the
same—was actually going to work in the diet
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“And who knows,” the letter ended in Heavy’s
characteristic way, “but that I shall fall in love
with one of the <em>blessés</em>. What a sweet name for
a wounded soldier! And, just tell me! Do you
think it possible? Can a poilu love a fat girl?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—“THE BOYS OF THE DRAFT”</h2>
<p>
“My goodness, Ruth Fielding!” demanded
Helen, after reading the characteristic letter from
Jennie Stone, “if she can go to France why can’t
we?”
</p>
<p>
Helen’s changed attitude did not surprise her
chum much. Ruth was quite used to Helen’s
vagaries. The latter was very apt to declare
against a course of action, for herself or her
friends, and then change over night.
</p>
<p>
The thought of her twin brother going to war
had at first shocked and startled Helen. Now
she added:
</p>
<p>
“For you know very well, Ruth Fielding, that
Tom Cameron should not be allowed to go over
there to France all alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Helen!” gasped the girl of the Red
Mill, “you don’t suppose that Tom is going to
constitute an Army of Invasion in his own person,
and attempt to whip the whole of Germany
before the rest of Uncle Sam’s boys jump
in?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“You may laugh!” cried Helen. “He’s only
a boy—and boys can’t get along without somebody
to look out for them. He never would
change his flannels at the right time, or keep his
feet dry.”
</p>
<p>
“I know you have always felt the overwhelming
responsibility of Tom’s upbringing, even
when he was at Seven Oaks and you and I were
at Briarwood.”
</p>
<p>
“Every boy needs the oversight of some feminine
eye. And I expect he’ll fall in love with the
first French girl he meets over there unless I’m
on the spot to warn him,” Helen went on.
</p>
<p>
“They are most attractive, I believe,” laughed
Ruth cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“‘Chic,’ as Madame Picolet used to say. You
remember her, our French teacher at Briarwood?”
Helen said.
</p>
<p>
“Poor little Picolet!” Ruth returned with
some gravity. “Do you know she has been writing
me?”
</p>
<p>
“Madame Picolet? You never said a word
about it!”
</p>
<p>
“But you knew she returned to France soon
after the war began?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. I knew that. But—but, to tell the
truth, I hadn’t thought of her at all for a long
time. Why does she write to you?”
</p>
<p>
“For help,” said Ruth quietly. “She has a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
work among soldiers’ widows and orphans—a
very worthy charity, indeed. I looked it up.”
</p>
<p>
“And sent her money, I bet!” cried the vigorous
Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Why—yes—what I felt I could spare,” Ruth
admitted.
</p>
<p>
“And never told any of us girls about it.
Think! All the Briarwood girls who knew little
Picolet!” Helen said with some heat. “Why
shouldn’t we have had a part in helping her, too?”
</p>
<p>
“My dear,” said her chum seriously, “do you
realize how little interest any of us felt in the
war until this last winter? And now our own
dear country is in it and we must think of our
own boys who are going, rather than of the needs
of the French, or the British, or even the Belgians.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth!” cried Helen suddenly, “perhaps
Madame Picolet might help us to get over there.”
</p>
<p>
“Over to France?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean to get into some work in France. She
knows us. She may have some influence,” said
the eager Helen.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth slowly shook her head. “No,” she
said. “If I go over there it must be to work for
our own boys. They are going. They will need
us. I want to do my all for Uncle Sam—for
these United States—and,” she added, pointing
to Uncle Jabez’s flag upon the pole in front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
the Red Mill farmhouse, “for the blessed old
flag. I am sorry for the wounded of our allies;
but the time has come now for us to think of the
needs of our own soldiers first. They are going
over. First our regular army and the guard;
then the boys of the draft.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yes! The boys of the draft,” sighed
Helen.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Ruth seized her chum’s wrist. “I’ve
got it, Helen! That is it! ‘<em>The boys of the
draft.</em>’”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! What’s the matter with you
now?” demanded Helen, wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>
“We will screen it. It will be great!” cried
Ruth. “I’ll go and see Mr. Hammond at once.
I can write the scenario in a few days, and it will
not take long to film it. The story of the draft,
and what the Red Cross can and will do for the
boys over there. Put it on the screen and show
it wherever a Red Cross drive is made during the
next few months. We’ll do it, Helen!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Yes! We’ll—do—it!” gasped her
chum breathlessly. “You mean that you will do
it and that I haven’t the first idea of what it is
you mean to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you have. A big film called ‘The
Boys of the Draft,’ taking a green squad right
through their training from the very first day
they are in camp. Fake the French and war
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
scenes, of course, but show the spectators just
what may and will happen over there and what
the Red Cross will do for the brave hearts who
fight for the country.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was excited. No doubt of that. Her
cheeks burned. Her eyes shone. She gestured
vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“I know you don’t see it as I do, honey,” she
added. “I can visualize the whole thing right
now. And Helen!”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, yes!” gasped Helen. “What
now?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to make Uncle Jabez see it! You
just see if I don’t.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—THE PATRIOTISM OF THE PURSE</h2>
<p>
While she was yet at boarding school at Briarwood
Hall Ruth had been successful in writing a
scenario for the Alectrion Film Corporation.
This is told of in “Ruth Fielding in Moving
Pictures.” Its production had been a matter to
arouse both the interest and amazement of her
friends. Mr. Hammond, the president of the
film-producing company, considered her a genius
in screen matters, and it was a fact that she had
gained a very practical grasp of the whole moving
picture business.
</p>
<p>
“The Heart of a Schoolgirl,” which Ruth had
written under spur of a great need at Briarwood
Hall, had practically rebuilt one of the dormitories
which had been destroyed by fire at a time
when the insurance on that particular building
had run out.
</p>
<p>
One of her romantic scenarios had been
screened at the Red Mill and on the picturesque
Lumano and along its banks. Then, less than a
year before, “The Forty-Niners” had been made;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
and during the succeeding winter this picture had
been shown all over the country and, as the
theatrical people say, “had played to big business.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had bought stock in the corporation and
was sometimes actually consulted now by Mr.
Hammond and the heads of departments as to
the policies of the concern. As the president
of the corporation had already written her,
the time was about ripe for another “big”
film.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was expected to suggest the idea,
at least, although the working out of the story
would probably be left to the director in the field.
He knew his people, his properties, and his locations.
The bare skeleton of the story was what
Mr. Hammond wanted.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s success in making virile “The Forty-Niners”
urged Mr. Hammond to hope for something
as good from her now. And, like most
composers of every kind, the real inspiration for
the new reel wonder had leaped to life on the
instant in her brain.
</p>
<p>
The idea of “The Boys of the Draft” came
from her talk with her chum, Helen Cameron.
Helen had a limited amount of pride in Ruth’s
success on this occasion for, as she said, she had
blunderingly “sicked Ruth on.” But, oddly
enough, Ruth Fielding’s first interest in the success
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
of the new picture was in what effect it might
have upon Uncle Jabez Potter’s purse.
</p>
<p>
The drive for Red Cross contributions was on
now all over the country. That effort confined
to the county in which Cheslow and the Red Mill
were located had begun early; but it had
gone stumblingly. Indeed, as Helen said, if
it was a drive, it was about like driving home the
cows!
</p>
<p>
Mr. Cameron had expected much of Ruth and
his own daughter among the farming people; but
they were actually behind the collectors who
worked in the towns. It was at a time in the year
when the men of the scattered communities were
working hard out of doors; and it is difficult to
interest farmers in anything but their crops during
the growing season. Indeed, it is absolutely
necessary that they should give their main attention
to those crops if a good harvest is to be
secured.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth felt that she was failing in this work
for the Red Cross just because she could not
interest her uncle, the old miller, sufficiently in
the matter. If she could not get him enthused,
how could she expect to obtain large contributions
from strangers?
</p>
<p>
After seeing a screen production of Ruth’s play
of the old West Uncle Jabez had for the first
time realized what a really wonderful thing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
filming of such pictures was. He admitted that
Ruth’s time was not being thrown away.
</p>
<p>
Then, he respected the ability of anybody who
could make money, and he saw this girl, whom he
had “taken in out of charity” as he had more than
once said, making more money in a given time—and
making it more easily—than he did in his
mill and through his mortgages and mining
investments.
</p>
<p>
If Uncle Jabez did not actually bow down to
the Golden Calf, he surely did think highly of
financial success. And he had begun to realize
that all this education Ruth had been getting
(quite unnecessary he had first believed) had led
her into a position where she was “making good.”
</p>
<p>
Through this slant in Uncle Jabez’s mind the
girl began to hope that she might encourage him
to do much more for the cause her heart was so
set on than he seemed willing to do. Uncle Jabez
was patriotic, but his patriotism had not as yet
affected his pocket.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Uncle Jabez knew that Ruth contemplated
helping to make another picture he
showed interest. He wanted to know about it,
and he figured with Aunt Alvirah “how much that
gal might make out’n her idees.”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake, Jabez Potter!” exclaimed
the little old woman, “ain’t you got airy idee in
your head ’cept money making?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
“I calc’late,” said the miller grimly, “that it’s
my idees about money in the past has give me what
I’ve got.”
</p>
<p>
“But our Ruthie is going to git up a big, patriotic
picture—somethin’ to stir the hearts of the
people when they think the boys air actually going
over to help them French folks win the war.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish,” cried the old woman shrilly, “that I
warn’t too old and too crooked, to do something
myself for the soldiers. But my back an’
my bones won’t let me, Jabez. And I ain’t got no
bank account. All I can do is to pray.”
</p>
<p>
The miller looked at her with his usual grim
smile. Perhaps it was a little quizzical on this
occasion.
</p>
<p>
“Do you calc’late to do any prayin’ about this
here filum Ruth is going to make, ‘The Boys of
the Draft’?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I sartinly be—for her success and the good it
may do.”
</p>
<p>
“By gum! she’ll make money, then,” declared
Uncle Jabez, who had unbounded faith in the
religion Aunt Alvirah professed—but he did
not.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, hearing this, developed another of her
inspirational ideas. Uncle Jabez fell into a trap
she laid for him, after having taken Mr. Hammond
into her confidence regarding what she proposed
doing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you’ll make a mint of money out’n
this draft story,” the miller said one evening,
when the actual work on the photographing of
the film was well under way.
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” admitted Ruth slowly. “But I
am afraid some parts of it will have to be cut or
changed because it would cost more than Mr.
Hammond cares to put into it at this time. You
know, the Alectrion Corporation is in the field
with several big things, and it takes a lot of
money.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t he borry it?” demanded the miller
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“He never does that. The only way in which
he accepts outside capital is to let moneyed men
buy into a picture he is making, taking their
chance along with the rest of us that the picture
will be a success.”
</p>
<p>
“Yep. An’ if it ain’t a success?” asked the
miller shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“Then their money is lost.”
</p>
<p>
“Ahem! That’s a hard sayin’,” muttered the
old man. “But if it does make a hit—like that
Forty-Niner story of yourn, Niece Ruth—then the
feller that buys in makes a nice little pile?”
</p>
<p>
“Our successes,” Ruth said with pride, “have
run from fifty to two hundred per cent profit.”
</p>
<p>
“My soul! Two hunderd! Ain’t that perfec’ly
scand’lous?” muttered Uncle Jabez. “An’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
here jest last week I let Amos Blodgett have a
thousand dollars on his farm at five an’ a ha’f per
cent.”
</p>
<p>
“But that investment is perfectly safe,” Ruth
said slyly.
</p>
<p>
“My soul! Yes. Blodgett’s lower forty’s
wuth more’n the mortgage. But sech winnin’s as
you speak of——! Niece Ruth how much is
needed to make this picture the kind of a picture
you want it to be?”
</p>
<p>
She told him—as she and Mr. Hammond had
already agreed. The idea was to divide the cost
in three parts and let Uncle Jabez invest to the
amount of one of the shares if he would.
</p>
<p>
“But, you see, Uncle Jabez, Mr. Hammond
does not feel as confident as I do about ‘The Boys
of the Draft,’ nor has he the same deep interest
in the picture. I want it to be a success—and I
believe it will be—because of the good it will do
the Red Cross campaign for funds.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” grunted the miller. “I’m bankin’
on your winnin’ anyway.” And perhaps his belief
in the efficacy of Aunt Alvirah Boggs’ prayers
had something to do with his “buying into” the
new picture.
</p>
<p>
The screening of the great film was rushed. A
campaign of advertising was entered into and the
fact that a share of the profits from the film was
to be devoted to Red Cross work made it popular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
at once. But Uncle Jabez showed some chagrin.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the meanin’ of it?” he demanded.
“Who’s goin’ to give his share of the profits to
any Red Cross? Not me!”
</p>
<p>
“But I am, Uncle Jabez,” Ruth said lightly.
“That was my intention from the first. But, of
course, that has nothing to do with you.”
</p>
<p>
“I sh’d say not! I sh’d say not!” grumbled
the miller. “I ain’t likely to git into a good thing
an’ then throw the profit away. I sh’d say
not!”
</p>
<p>
The film was shown in New York, in several
other big cities, and in Cheslow simultaneously.
Ruth arranged for this first production with the
proprietor of the best movie house in the local
town, because she was anxious to see it and could
not spare the time to go to New York.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammond, as though inspired by Ruth’s
example, telegraphed on the day of the first exhibition
of the film that he would donate his share
of the profits as well to the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nother dern fool!” sputtered Uncle Jabez.
“Never see the beat. Wal! if you’n he both
want to give ‘way a small fortune, it’s your own
business, I suppose. All the less need of me givin’
any of my share.”
</p>
<p>
He went with Ruth to see the production of
the film. Indeed, he would not have missed that
“first night” for the world. The pretty picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
house was crowded. It had got so that when
anything from the pen of the girl of the Red
Mill was produced the neighbors made a gala
day of it.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was proud of her success. And
she had nothing on this occasion to be sorry for,
the film being a splendid piece of work.
</p>
<p>
But, aside from this fact, “The Boys of the
Draft” was opportune, and the audience was
more than usually sensitive. The very next day
the first quota of the drafted boys from Cheslow
would march away to the training camp.
</p>
<p>
The hearts of the people were stirred. They
saw a faithful reproduction of what the boys
would go through in training, what they might
endure in the trenches, and particularly what the
Red Cross was doing for soldiers under similar
conditions elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As though spellbound, Uncle Jabez sat through
the long reel. The appeal at the end, with the
Red Cross nurse in the hospital ward, the dying
soldier’s head pillowed upon her breast while she
whispered the comfort into his dulling ear that his
mother would have whispered——
</p>
<p>
Ah, it brought the audience to its feet at the
“fadeout”—and in tears! It was so human, so
real, so touching, that there was little audible
comment as they filed out to the soft playing of
the organ.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
But Uncle Jabez burst out helplessly when
they were in the street. He wiped the tears from
the hard wrinkles of his old face with frankness
and his voice was husky as he declared:
</p>
<p>
“Niece Ruth! I’m converted to your Red
Cross. Dern it all! you kin have ev’ry cent of my
share of the profit on that picter—ev’ry cent!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—ON THE WAY</h2>
<p>
Tom Cameron came home on a furlough from
the officers’ training camp the day that the boys
of the first draft departed from Cheslow. It
stabbed the hearts of many mothers and fathers
with a quick pain to see him march through the
street so jaunty and debonair.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Tommy!” his sister cried. “You’re a
<em>man!</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Lay off! Lay off!” begged her twin, not at
all pleased. “You might have awakened to the
fact that I was out of rompers some years ago.
Your eyesight has been bad.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, he was rather inclined to ignore her
and “flock with his father,” as Helen put it to
Ruth. The father and son had something in
common now that the girl could not altogether
understand. They sat before the cold grate in
the library, their chairs drawn near to each other,
and smoked sometimes for an hour without saying
a word.
</p>
<p>
“But, Ruthie,” Helen said, her eyes big and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
moist, “each seems to know just what the other is
thinking about. Sometimes papa says a word,
and sometimes Tom; and the other nods and
there is perfect understanding. It—it’s almost
uncanny.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I know what you mean,” said the more
observant girl of the Red Mill. “We grew up
some time ago, Helen. And you know we have
rather thought of Tom as a boy, still.
</p>
<p>
“But he is a man now. There is a difference
in the sexes in their attitude to this war which
should establish in all our minds that we are not
equal.”
</p>
<p>
“Who aren’t equal?” demanded Helen, almost
wrathfully, for she was a militant feminist.
</p>
<p>
“Men and women are not equal, dear. And
they never will be. Wearing mannish clothes and
doing mannish labor will never give women the
same outlook upon life that men have. And when
men encourage us to believe that our minds are
the same as theirs, they do it almost always for
their own selfish ends—or because there is something
feminine about their minds.”
</p>
<p>
“Traitor!” cried Helen.
</p>
<p>
“No,” sighed Ruth. “Only honesty.
</p>
<p>
“Tom and his father understand each other’s
thoughts and feelings as you and your father never
could. After all, in the strongest association between
father and daughter there is the barrier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
of sex that cannot be surmounted. You know
yourself, Helen, that at a certain point you consider
your father much of a big boy and treat him
accordingly. That, they tell us, is the ‘mother
instinct’ in the female, and I guess it is.
</p>
<p>
“On the other hand, I have seen girls and
their mothers together (we never had mothers
after we were little kiddies, Helen, and we’ve
missed it) but I have seen such perfect understanding
and appreciation between mothers and
their daughters that it was as though the same
soul dwelt in two bodies.”
</p>
<p>
Helen sniffed in mingled scorn and doubt over
Ruth’s philosophy. Then she said in an aggrieved
tone: “But papa and Tom ought not to shut me
out of their lives—even in a small way.”
</p>
<p>
“The penalty of being a girl,” replied Ruth,
practically. “Tom doesn’t believe, I suppose, that
girls would quite understand his manly feelings,”
she added with a sudden elfish smile.
</p>
<p>
“Cat’s foot!” ejaculated the twin, with
scorn.
</p>
<p>
Tom Cameron, however, did not run altogether
true to form if Ruth was right in her philosophy.
He had always been used to talking seriously at
times with Ruth, and during this furlough he
found time to have a long and confidential talk
with the girl of the Red Mill. This might be the
only furlough he would have before sailing for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
France, for he had already obtained his commission
as second lieutenant.
</p>
<p>
There was an understanding between the young
man and Ruth Fielding—an unspoken and tacit
feeling that they were “made for each other.”
They were young. Ruth’s thoughts had never
dwelt much upon love and marriage. She never
looked on each man she met half-wonderingly as
a possible husband. She had never met any man
with this feeling. Perhaps, in part, that was, unconsciously
to herself, because Tom had always
been so a part of her life and her thoughts.
Lately, however, she had come to the realization
that if Tom should really ask her to marry him
when his education was completed and he was
established in the world, the girl of the Red Mill
would be very likely to consider his offer seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Things aren’t coming out just as we had
planned, Ruth,” the young man said on this occasion.
“I guess this war is going to knock a lot of
plans in the head. If it lasts several years, many
of us fellows, if we come through it safely, will
feel that we are too old to go back to college.
</p>
<p>
“Can you imagine a fellow who has spent
months in the trenches, and has done the things
that the soldiers are having to do and to endure
and to learn over there—can you imagine his
coming back here and going to school again?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom! I suppose that is so. The returned
soldier must feel vastly older and more experienced
in every way than men who have never
heard the bursting of shells and the rattle of
machine guns. Oh, dear, Tommy! Are we going
to know you at all when you come back?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe not,” grinned Tom. “I may raise
whiskers. Most of the poilus do, I understand.
But you could not really imagine a regiment of
Uncle Sam’s soldiers that were not clean shaven.”
</p>
<p>
“We want to see it all, too—Helen and I,”
Ruth said, sighing. “We are so far away from
the front.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” he exclaimed. “I should think
you would be glad.”
</p>
<p>
“But some women must go,” Ruth told him
gravely. “Why not us?”
</p>
<p>
“You—— Well, I don’t know about you,
Ruth. You seem somehow different. I expect
you could look out for yourself anywhere. But
Helen hasn’t got your sense.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear him!” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“It’s true,” he declared doggedly. “She hasn’t.
Father and I have talked it over. Nell is crazy
to go—and I tell father he would be crazy to let
her. But it may be that he will go to London and
Paris himself, for there is some work he can do
for the Government. Of course, Helen would
insist upon accompanying him in that event.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom!” exclaimed Ruth again.
</p>
<p>
“Why, they’d take you along, of course, if you
wanted to go,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t wish to go in any such way,” the
girl of the Red Mill declared. “I want to go for
just one purpose—<em>to help</em>. And it must be something
worth while. There will be enough dilettante
assistants in every branch of the work. My
position must mean something to the cause, as
well as to me, or I will stay right here in
Cheslow.”
</p>
<p>
He looked at her with the old admiration dawning
in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! The same old Ruthie, aren’t you?” he
murmured. “The same independent, ambitious
girl, whose work must <em>count</em>. Well, I fancy your
chance will come. We all seem to be on our way.
I wonder to what end?”
</p>
<p>
There was no sentimental outcome of their
talk. After all they were only over the line between
boy-and-girlhood and the grown-up state.
Tom was too much of a man to wish to anchor a
girl to him by any ties when the future was so
uncertain. And nothing had really ever happened
to them to stir those deeper passions which
must rise to the surface when two people talk of
love.
</p>
<p>
They were merely the best of friends. They
had no other ties of a warmer nature than those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
which bound them in friendship to each other.
They felt confidence in each other if the future
was propitious; but now——
</p>
<p>
“I am sure you will make your mark in the
army, Tom, dear,” Ruth said to him. “And I
shall think of you—wherever you are and wherever
I am—always!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—THE NEAREST DUTY</h2>
<p>
The county drive for Red Cross funds had
been a great success; and many people declared
that Ruth’s work had been that which had told
the most in the effort. Uncle Jabez inspired many
of the more parsimonious of the county to follow
his lead in giving to the cause. And, of course,
“The Boys of the Draft” was making money for
the Red Cross all over the country, as well as in
and about Cheslow.
</p>
<p>
After Tom Cameron went back to camp Ruth’s
longing for real service in the war work fairly
obsessed her mind. She could, of course, offer
herself to do some unimportant work in France,
paying her own transportation and expenses, and
become one of that small army of women who
first went over, many of whom were more ornamental,
if the truth were told, than useful in the
grim work that was to follow.
</p>
<p>
But the girl of the Red Mill, as she told Tom
Cameron, wished to make whatever she did count.
Yet she was spurred by no inordinate desire for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
praise or adulation. Merely she wanted to feel
that she actually was doing her all for Uncle Sam.
</p>
<p>
Being untrained in nursing it could not be hospital
work—not of the usual kind. Ruth wanted
something that her capabilities fitted. Something
she could do and do well. Something that was of
a responsible nature and would count in the long
run for the cause of humanity.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile she did not refuse the small duties
that fell to her lot. She was always ready to
“jump in” and do her share in any event. Helen
often said that her chum’s doctrinal belief was
summed up in the quotation from the Sunday school
hymn: “You in your small corner, and I
in mine!”
</p>
<p>
One day at the Cheslow chapter it was said
that there was need of somebody who could help
out in the supply department of the State Headquarters
in Robinsburg. A woman or girl was
desired who would not have to be paid a salary,
and preferably one who could pay her own living
expenses.
</p>
<p>
“That’s me!” exclaimed Ruth to Helen. “I
certainly can fill that bill.”
</p>
<p>
“But it really amounts to nothing, dear,” her
chum said doubtfully. “It seems a pity to waste
your brain and perfectly splendid ideas for organization
and the like in such a position.”
</p>
<p>
“Fiddle-de-dee!” ejaculated Ruth, quoting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
Uncle Jabez. “Nobody has yet appreciated my
‘perfectly splendid ideas of organization,’” and
she repeated the phrase with some scorn, “so I
would better put forward some of my more simple
talents. I have a good head for figures, I can letter
packages, I can even stick stamps on letters
and do other office work. My capabilities will
not be strained. And, then,” she added, “I feel
that in State Headquarters I may be in a better
position to ‘grab off’ something really worth
while.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Johannah on the spot,’ as it were?” said
Helen. “But you’ll have to go down there to
live, Ruthie.”
</p>
<p>
“The Y. W. C. A. will take me in, I am sure,”
declared her friend. “I am not afraid of being
alone in a great city—at my age and with my
experience!”
</p>
<p>
She telephoned to Robinsburg and was told to
come on. Naturally, by this time, the heads of
the State Red Cross, at least, knew who Ruth
Fielding was.
</p>
<p>
But every girl who had raised a large sum of
money for the cause was not suited to such work
as was waiting for her at headquarters. She
knew that she must prove her fitness.
</p>
<p>
Helen took her over in the car the next morning
and was inclined to be tearful when they separated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“Just does seem as though I couldn’t get on
without you, Ruthie!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you are worse than poor Aunt Alvirah!
Every time I go away from home she acts as
though I might never come back again. And as
for you, Helen Cameron, you have plenty to do.
You have my share of Red Cross work in Cheslow
to do as well as your own. Don’t forget
that.”
</p>
<p>
Headquarters was a busy place. The very
things Ruth told Helen she could do, she did do—and
a multitude besides. Everything was systematized,
and the work went on in a businesslike
manner. Everybody was working hard and
unselfishly.
</p>
<p>
At least, so Ruth at first thought. Then, before
she had been there two days, she chanced
into another department upon an errand and
came face to face with Mrs. Rose Mantel, the
woman in black.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! How d’do!” said the woman with her
set smile. “I heard you were coming here to help
us, Miss Fielding. Hope you’ll like it.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” Ruth returned gravely.
</p>
<p>
She had very little to say to the woman in black,
although the latter, as the days passed, seemed
desirous of ingratiating herself into the college
girl’s good opinion. But that Mrs. Mantel could
not do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
It seemed that Mrs. Mantel was an expert
bookkeeper and accountant. She confided to Ruth
that, before she had married and “dear Herny”
had died, she had been engaged in the offices of
one of the largest cotton brokerage houses in New
Orleans. She still had a little money left from
“poor Herny’s” insurance, and she could live on
that while she was “doing her bit” for the Red
Cross.
</p>
<p>
Ruth made no comment. Of a sudden Mrs.
Mantel seemed to have grown patriotic. No
more did she repeat slanders of the Red Cross,
but was working for that organization.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding would not forbid a person “seeing
the light” and becoming converted to the
worthiness of the cause; but somehow she could
not take Mrs. Mantel and her work at their face
value.
</p>
<p>
Gradually, as the weeks fled, Ruth became acquainted
with others of the busy workers; with
Mr. Charles Mayo, who governed this headquarters
and seldom spoke of anything save the work—so
she did not know whether he had a family,
or social life, or anything else but just Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
There was a Mr. Legrand, whom she did not
like so well. He seemed to be a Frenchman, although
he spoke perfect English. He was a dark
man with steady, keen eyes behind thick lenses,
and, unusual enough in this day, he wore a heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
beard. His voice was a bark, but it did not seem
that he meant to be unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
Legrand and a man named José, who could be
nothing but a Mexican, often were with the
woman in black—both in the offices and out of
them. Ruth took her meals at a restaurant near
by, although she roomed in the Y. W. C. A. building,
as she said she should. In that restaurant she
often saw the woman in black dining with her two
cavaliers, as Ruth secretly termed Legrand and
José.
</p>
<p>
It was a trio that the girl of the Red Mill found
herself interested in, but with whom she wished
to have nothing to do.
</p>
<p>
All sorts and conditions of people, however,
were turning to Red Cross work. “Why,” Ruth
asked herself, “criticize the intentions of any of
them?” She felt sometimes as though her condemnation
of Mrs. Mantel, even though secret,
was really wicked.
</p>
<p>
But in the bookkeeping and accounting department—handling
the funds that came in, as
well as the expense accounts—a dishonest person
might do much harm to the cause. And Ruth
knew in her heart that Mrs. Mantel was not an
honest woman.
</p>
<p>
Her tale that day at the Ladies’ Aid Society,
in Cheslow, had been false—strictly false. The
woman knew it at the time, and she knew it now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
Ruth was sure that every time Mrs. Mantel
looked at her with her set smile she was thinking
that Ruth had caught her in a prevarication and
had not forgotten it.
</p>
<p>
Yet the girl of the Red Mill felt that she could
say nothing about Mrs. Mantel to Mr. Mayo, or
to anybody else in authority. She had no proved
facts.
</p>
<p>
Besides, she had never been so busy before in
all her life, and Ruth Fielding was no sluggard.
It seemed as though every moment of her waking
hours was filled and running over with duties.
</p>
<p>
She often worked long into the evening in her
department at the Red Cross bureau. She might
have missed the folks at home and her girl
friends more had it not been for the work that
crowded upon her.
</p>
<p>
One evening, as she came down from the loft
above the business office where she had been
working alone, she remarked that there was a
light in the office. Mrs. Mantel and her assistants
did not usually work at night.
</p>
<p>
The door stood ajar. Ruth looked in with
frank curiosity. She saw Mr. José, the black-looking
Mexican, alone in the room. He had
taken both of the chemical fire extinguishers from
the wall—one had hung at one end of the room
and the other at the other end—and was doing
something to them. Repairing them, perhaps, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
merely cleaning them. He sat there cheerfully
whistling in a low tone and manipulating a polishing
rag, or something of the kind. He had a
bucket beside him.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if he can’t sleep nights, and that is
why he is so busily engaged?” thought Ruth, as
she went on out of the building. “I never knew
of his being so workative before.”
</p>
<p>
But the matter made no real impression on her
mind. It was a transitory thought entirely. She
went to her clean little cell in the Y. W. C. A.
home and forgot all about Mr. José and the fire
extinguishers.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—TOM SAILS, AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS</h2>
<p>
“You can see your son, Second Lieutenant
Thomas Cameron, before he sails for France, if
you will be at the Polk Hotel, at eight o’clock
to-morrow p. m.”
</p>
<p>
There have been other telegrams sent and received
of more moment than the above, perhaps;
but none that could have created a more profound
impression in the Cameron household.
</p>
<p>
There have been not a few similar messages
put on the telegraph wires and received by anxious
parents during these months since America
has really got into the World War.
</p>
<p>
There is every necessity for secrecy in the sailing
of the transports for France. The young
officers themselves have sometimes told more to
their relatives than they should before the hour
of sailing. So the War Department takes every
precaution to safeguard the crossing of our boys
who go to fight the Huns.
</p>
<p>
With Mr. Cameron holding an important government position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
and being ready himself to go
across before many weeks, it was only natural
that he should have this information sent him that
he might say good-bye to Tom. The latter had
already been a fortnight with “his boys” in the
training camp and was fixed in his assignment to
his division of the expeditionary forces.
</p>
<p>
Ruth chanced to be at the Outlook, as the
Cameron home was called, for over Sunday when
this telegram was received. Both she and Helen
were vastly excited.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m going with you! I must see Tommy
once more,” cried the twin with an outburst of
sobs and tears that made her father very unhappy.
</p>
<p>
“My dear! You cannot,” Mr. Cameron tried
to explain.
</p>
<p>
“I can! I must!” the girl cried. “I know I’ll
never see Tommy again. He—he’s going over
there to—to be shot——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t, dear!” begged Ruth, taking her chum
into her arms. “You must not talk that way.
This is war——”
</p>
<p>
“And is war altogether a man’s game? Aren’t
we to have anything to say about it, or what the
Government shall do with our brothers?”
</p>
<p>
“It is no game,” sighed Ruth Fielding. “It is
a very different thing. And our part in it is to
give, and give generously. Our loved ones if we
must.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to give Tom!” Helen declared.
“I can never be patriotic enough to give him to
the country. And that’s all there is to it!”
</p>
<p>
“Be a good girl, Helen, and brace up,” advised
her father, but quite appreciating the girl’s feelings.
There had always been a bond between
the Cameron twins stronger than that between
most brothers and sisters.
</p>
<p>
“I know I shall never see him again,” wailed
the girl.
</p>
<p>
“I hope he’ll not hear that you said that, dear,”
said the girl of the Red Mill, shaking her head.
“We must send him away with cheerfulness. You
tell him from me, Mr. Cameron, that I send my
love and I hope he will come back a major at
least.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll be killed!” Helen continued to wail. “I
know he will!”
</p>
<p>
But that did not help things a mite. Mr.
Cameron went off late that night and reached the
rendezvous called for in the telegram. It was
in a port from which several transports were
sailing within a few hours, and he came back with
a better idea of what it meant for thousands of
men under arms to get away on a voyage across
the seas.
</p>
<p>
Tom was busy with his men; but he had time
to take supper with his father at the hotel and
then got permission for Mr. Cameron to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
aboard the ship with him and see how comfortable
the War Department had made things for
the expeditionary force.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Cameron stopped at Robinsburg on his
return to tell Ruth about it, for she had returned
to Headquarters, of course, on Monday, and was
working quite as hard as before. He brought,
too, a letter for Ruth from Tom, and just what
their soldier-boy said in that missive the girl of
the Red Mill never told.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was left, when her friends’ father went
on to Cheslow, with a great feeling of emptiness
in her life. It was not alone because of Tom’s
departure for France; Mr. Cameron and Helen,
too, would soon go across the sea.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Cameron had repeated Helen’s offer—that
Ruth should accompany them. But the girl,
though grateful, refused. She did not for a moment
belittle his efforts for the Government, or
Helen’s interest in the war.
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Cameron was a member of a commission
that was to investigate certain matters
and come back to make report. He would not be
over there long.
</p>
<p>
As for Helen, Ruth was quite sure she would
join some association of wealthy women and girls
in Paris, as Jennie Stone had, and consider that
she was “doing her bit.” Ruth wanted something
more real than that. She was in earnest. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
did not wish to be carefully sheltered from all
hard work and even from the dangers “over
there.” She desired a real part in what was going
forward.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, while waiting her chance, she did
not allow herself to become gloomy or morose.
That was not Ruth Fielding’s way.
</p>
<p>
“I always know where to come when I wish to
see a cheerful face,” Mr. Mayo declared, putting
his head in at her door one day. “You always
have a smile on tap. How do you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“I practice before my glass every morning,”
Ruth declared, laughing. “But sometimes, during
the day, I’m afraid my expression slips. I
can’t always remember to smile when I am counting
and packing these sweaters, and caps, and
all, for the poor boys who, some of them, are
going to stand up and be shot, or gassed, or
blinded by liquid fire.”
</p>
<p>
“It is hard,” sighed the chief, wagging his
head. “If it wasn’t knowing that we are doing
just a little good——But not as much as I could
wish! Collections seem very small. Our report
is not going to be all I could wish this month.”
</p>
<p>
He went away, leaving Ruth with a thought
that did not make it any easier for her to smile.
She saw people all day long coming into the
building and seeking out the cashier’s desk, where
Mrs. Mantel sat, to hand over contributions of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
money to the Red Cross. If only each brought a
dollar there should be a large sum added to the
local treasury each day.
</p>
<p>
There was no way of checking up these payments.
The money passed through the hands of
the lady in black and only by her accounts on
the day ledger and a system of card index taken
from that ledger by Mr. Legrand, who worked as
her assistant, could the record be found of the
moneys contributed to the Red Cross at this
station.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was not naturally of a suspicious
disposition; but the honesty of Mrs. Mantel
and the real interest of that woman in the cause
were still keenly questioned in Ruth’s mind.
</p>
<p>
She wondered if Mr. Mayo knew who the
woman really was. Was her story of widowhood,
and of her former business experience in
New Orleans strictly according to facts? What
might be learned about the woman in black if
inquiry was made in that Southern city?
</p>
<p>
Yet at times Ruth would have felt condemned
for her suspicions had it not been for the daily
sight of Mrs. Mantel’s hard smile and her black,
glittering eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Snakes’ eyes,” thought the girl of the Red
Mill. “Quite as bright and quite as malevolent.
Mrs. Mantel certainly does not love me, despite
her soft words and sweet smile.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
There was some stir in the headquarters at last
regarding a large draft of Red Cross workers to
make up another expeditionary force to France.
Two full hospital units were going and a base
supply unit as well. Altogether several hundred
men and women would sail in a month’s time for
the other side.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s heart beat quicker at the thought. Was
there a prospect for her to go over in some capacity
with this quota?
</p>
<p>
Most of the candidates for all departments of
the expeditionary force were trained in the work
they were to do. It was ridiculous to hope for
an appointment in the hospital force. No nurse
among them all had served less than two years
in a hospital, and many of them had served three
and four.
</p>
<p>
She asked Mr. Mayo what billets there were
open in the supply unit; but the chief did not
know. The State had supplied few workers as
yet who had been sent abroad; Robinsburg, up
to this time, none at all.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Miss Fielding, you must not think of
going over there!” he cried. “We need you here.
If all our dependable women go to France, how
shall we manage here?”
</p>
<p>
“You would manage very well,” Ruth told
him. “This should be a training school for the
work over there. I know that I can give any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
intelligent girl such an idea of my work in three
weeks that you would never miss me.”
</p>
<p>
“Impossible, Miss Fielding!”
</p>
<p>
“Quite possible, I assure you. I want to go.
I feel I can do more over there than I can here.
A thousand girls who can’t go could be found to
do what I do here. Approve my application,
will you please, Mr. Mayo?”
</p>
<p>
He did this after some hesitation. “Am I
going to lose everybody at once?” he grumbled.
</p>
<p>
“Why, only poor little me,” laughed Ruth
Fielding.
</p>
<p>
“Yours is the seventh application I have
O.K.’d. And several others may ask yet. The
fire is spreading.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Who?”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to lose Mrs. Mantel for one.
I understand that the Red Cross wants her for a
much more important work in France.”
</p>
<p>
For a little while Ruth doubted after all if she
so much desired to go to France. The fact that
Mrs. Mantel was going came as a shock to her
mind and made her hesitate. Suppose she should
meet the woman in black over there? Suppose
her work should be connected with that of the
woman whom she so much suspected and disliked?
</p>
<p>
Then her better sense and her patriotism came
to the force. What had she to do with Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
Mantel, after all? She was not the woman’s
keeper. Nor could it be possible that Mrs. Mantel
would disturb herself much over Ruth Fielding,
no matter where they might meet.
</p>
<p>
Was Ruth Fielding willing to work for the Red
Cross only in ways that would be wholly pleasant
and with people of whom she could entirely approve?
The girl asked herself this seriously.
</p>
<p>
She put the thought behind her with distaste
at her own narrowness of vision. Born of Yankee
stock, she was naturally conservative to the
very marrow of her bones. This New England
attitude is not altogether a curse; but it sometimes
leads one out of broad paths.
</p>
<p>
Surely the work was broad enough for both
her and the woman in black to do what they
might without conflict. “I’ll do my part; what
has Mrs. Mantel to do with me?” she determined.
</p>
<p>
Before Ruth had a chance to tell her chum of
the application she had put in, Helen wrote her
hurriedly that Mr. Cameron’s commission was to
sail in two days from Boston. Ruth could not
leave her work, but she wrote a long letter to her
dearest chum and sent it by special delivery to
the Boston hotel, where she knew the Camerons
would stop for a night.
</p>
<p>
It really seemed terrible, that her chum and her
father should go without Ruth seeing them again;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
but she did not wish to leave her work while her
application for an assignment to France was pending.
It might mean that she would lose her chance
altogether.
</p>
<p>
She only told Helen in the letter that she, too,
hoped to be “over there” some day soon.
</p>
<p>
But several days slipped by and her case was not
mentioned by Mr. Mayo. It seemed pretty hard
to Ruth. She was ready and able to go and nobody
wanted her!
</p>
<p>
The weather chanced to be unpleasant, too, and
that is often closely linked up to one’s very deepest
feelings. Ruth’s philosophy could not overcome
the effect of a foggy, dripping day. Her
usual cheerfulness dropped several degrees.
</p>
<p>
It drew on toward evening, and the patter of
raindrops on the panes grew louder. The glistening
umbrellas in the street, as she looked down
upon them from the window, looked like many,
many black mushrooms. Ruth knew she would
have a dreary evening.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly she heard a door bang on the floor
below—a shout and then a crash of glass.
Next——
</p>
<p>
“Fire! Fire! Fire!”
</p>
<p>
In an instant she was out of her room and at
the head of the stairs. It was an old building—a
regular firetrap. Mr. Mayo had dashed out of
his office and was shouting up the stairs:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come down! Down, every one of you!
Fire!”
</p>
<p>
Through the open transom over the door of
Mrs. Mantel’s office Ruth saw that one end of the
room was ablaze.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—SUSPICIONS</h2>
<p>
There was a patter of feet overhead and racing
down the stairway came half a dozen frightened
people. They had been aroused by Mr.
Mayo’s shout, and they knew that if the flames
reached the stairway first they would be driven to
the fire escape.
</p>
<p>
There seemed little danger of the fire reaching
the stairs, however; for when Ruth got to the
lower hall the door of the burning office had been
opened again, and she saw one of the porters
squirting the chemical fire extinguisher upon the
blaze.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Legrand had flung open the door, and he
was greatly excited. He held his left hand in his
right, as though it were hurt.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Mrs. Mantel?” demanded Mr.
Mayo.
</p>
<p>
“Gone!” gasped Legrand. “Lucky she did.
That oil spread all over her desk and papers. It’s
all afire.”
</p>
<p>
“I was opening a gallon of lubricating oil. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
broke and spurted everywhere. I cut myself—see?”
</p>
<p>
He showed his hand. Ruth saw that blood
seemed to be running from the cut freely. But
she was more interested in the efforts of the porter.
His extinguisher seemed to be doing very
little good.
</p>
<p>
Ruth heard Mr. Mayo trying to discover the
cause of the fire; but Mr. Legrand seemed unable
to tell that. He ran out to a drugstore to have
his hand attended to.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mayo seized the second extinguisher from
the wall. The porter flung his down, at the same
time yelling:
</p>
<p>
“No good! No good, I tell you, Mr. Mayo!
Everything’s got to go. Those extinguishers must
be all wrong. The chemicals have evaporated,
or something.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mayo tried the one he had seized with no
better result. While this was going on Ruth
Fielding suddenly remembered something—remembered
it with a shock. She had seen the man,
José, tampering with those same extinguishers
some days before.
</p>
<p>
While a certain spray was puffed forth from
the nozzle of the extinguisher, it seemed to have
no effect on the flames which were, as the porter
declared, spreading rapidly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mantel’s big desk and the file cabinet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
were all afire. Nothing could save the papers
and books.
</p>
<p>
An alarm had been turned in by somebody, and
now the first of the fire department arrived.
These men brought in extinguishers that had an
effect upon the flames at once. The fire was quite
quenched in five minutes more.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had retreated to Mr. Mayo’s office. She
heard one of the fire chiefs talking to the gentleman
at the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“What caused that blaze anyway?” the fireman
demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I understand some oil was spilled.”
</p>
<p>
“What kind of oil?” snapped the other.
</p>
<p>
“Lubricating oil.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! It acted more like benzine or
naphtha to me. But you haven’t told me how it
got lit up?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. The porter says he first saw
flames rising from the waste basket between the
big desk and the file cabinet,” Mr. Mayo said.
“Then the fire spread both ways.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! The insurance adjusters will be after
you. I’ve got to report my belief. Looks as
though somebody had been mighty careless with
some inflammable substance. What were you
using oil at all for here?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I could not tell you,” Mr. Mayo said. “I
will ask Mr. Legrand when he comes back.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
But Ruth learned in the morning that Legrand
had not returned. Nobody seemed to know
where he lived. Mrs. Mantel said he had moved
recently, but she did not know where to.
</p>
<p>
The insurance adjusters did make a pertinent
inquiry about the origin of the fire. But nobody
had been in the office with Legrand when it started
save the porter, and he had already told all he had
seen. There was no reason for charging anybody
else with carelessness but the missing man.
</p>
<p>
Save in one particular. Mrs. Mantel seemed
horror-stricken when she saw the charred remains
of her desk and the file cabinet. The files of cards
were completely destroyed. The cards were
merely brown husks—those that were not ashes.
The records of contributions for six months past
were completely burned.
</p>
<p>
“But you, fortunately, have the ledgers in the
safe, have you not, Mrs. Mantel?” the Chief said.
</p>
<p>
The woman in black broke down and wept.
“How careless you will think me, Mr. Mayo,”
she cried. “I left the two ledgers on my desk.
Legrand said he wished to compare certain figures——”
</p>
<p>
“The ledgers are destroyed, too?” gasped the
man.
</p>
<p>
“There are their charred remains,” declared
the woman, pointing dramatically to the burned
debris where her desk had stood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
There was not a line to show how much had
been given to the Red Cross at this station, or who
had given it! When Mr. Mayo opened the safe
he found less than two thousand dollars in cash
and checks and noted upon the bank deposit book;
and the month was almost ended. Payment was
made to Headquarters of all collections every
thirty days.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mantel seemed heartbroken. Legrand
did not appear again at the Red Cross rooms.
But the woman in black declared that the funds as
shown in the safe must be altogether right, for she
had locked the safe herself and remembered that
the funds were not more than the amount found.
</p>
<p>
“But we have had some large contributions during
the month, Mrs. Mantel,” Mr. Mayo said
weakly.
</p>
<p>
“Not to my knowledge, Mr. Mayo,” the
woman declared, her eyes flashing. “Our contributions
for some weeks have been scanty. People
are getting tired of giving to the Red Cross, I
fear.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth heard something of this discussion, but
not all. She did not know what to think about
Mrs. Mantel and Legrand. And then, there was
José, the man whom she had seen tampering with
the fire extinguishers!
</p>
<p>
Should she tell Mr. Mayo of her suspicions?
Or should she go to the office of the fire insurance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
adjustors? Or should she keep completely out
of the matter?
</p>
<p>
Had Mr. Mayo been a more forceful man
Ruth might have given him her confidence. But
she feared that, although he was a hard-working
official and loyal to the core, he did not possess
the quality of wisdom necessary to enable him to
handle the situation successfully.
</p>
<p>
Besides, just at this time, she heard from New
York. Her application had been investigated and
she was informed that she would be accepted for
work with the base supply unit about to sail for
France, with the proviso, of course, that she
passed the medical examination and would pay her
share of the unit’s expenses and for her own support.
</p>
<p>
She had to tell Mr. Mayo, bid good-bye to her
fellow workers, and leave Robinsburg within two
hours. She had only three days to make ready
before going to New York, and she wished to
spend all of that time at the Red Mill.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>Chapter XI—SAID IN GERMAN</h2>
<p>
Ruth Fielding had made preparations for
travel many times before; but this venture she was
about to undertake was different from her previous
flights from the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my pretty! Oh, my pretty!” sighed Aunt
Alvirah Boggs. “It seems as though this life is
just made up of partings. You ain’t no more to
home than you’re off again. And how do I know
I shall ever set my two eyes on you once more,
Ruthie?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve always come back so far, Aunt Alvirah—like
the bad penny that I am,” Ruth told her
cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!” groaned
Aunt Alvirah, sinking into her chair by the sunny
window. “No bad penny in your case, my pretty.
Your returns air always like that of the bluebird’s
in the spring—and jest as much for happiness as
they say the bluebird is. What would your Uncle
Jabez and me do without you?”
</p>
<p>
“But it will be only for a few months. I might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
remain away as long if I returned to Ardmore for
my junior year.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but that’s not like going away over to
France where there is so much danger and
trouble,” the little old woman objected.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry about me, dear,” urged Ruth,
with great gentleness.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know what may happen,” continued
Aunt Alvirah. “A single month at my time o’ life
is longer’n a year at your age, my pretty.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am sure to come back,” Ruth cried.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll hope so. I shall pray for you, my
pretty. But there’ll be fear eatin’ at our hearts
every day that you are so far from us.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jabez likewise expressed himself as loath
to have her go; yet his extreme patriotism inspired
him to wish her Godspeed cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“I vum! I’d like to be goin’ with you. Only
with Old Betsey on my shoulder!” declared the
miller. “You don’t want to take the old gun with
you, do you, Niece Ruth?” he added, with twinkling
eyes. “I’ve had her fixed. And she ought
to be able to shoot a Hun or two yet.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not going to shoot Germans,” said Ruth,
shaking her head. “I only hope to do what I can
in saving our boys after the battles. I can’t even
nurse them—poor dears! My all that I do seems
so little.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” grunted Uncle Jabez. “I reckon you’ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
do full and plenty. If you don’t it’ll be the first
time in your life that you fall down on a job.”
</p>
<p>
Which was remarkably warm commendation
for the miller to give, and Ruth appreciated it
deeply.
</p>
<p>
He drove her to town himself and put her on
the train for New York. “Don’t you git into no
more danger over there than you kin help, Niece
Ruth,” he urged. “Good-bye!”
</p>
<p>
She traveled alone to the metropolis, and that
without hearing from or seeing any of her fellow-workers
at the Red Cross rooms in Robinsburg.
She did wonder much, however, what the outcome
of the fire had been.
</p>
<p>
What had become of Mrs. Rose Mantel, the
woman in black? Had she been finally suspected
by Mr. Mayo, and would she be refused further
work with the organization because of the outcome
of the fire? Ruth could not but believe that
the conflagration had been caused to cover shortages
in the Red Cross accounts.
</p>
<p>
At the Grand Central Terminal Ruth was met
by a very lovely lady, a worker in the Red Cross,
who took her home to her Madison Avenue residence,
where Ruth was to remain for the few days
she was to be in the city.
</p>
<p>
“It is all I can do,” said the woman smiling,
when Ruth expressed her wonder that she should
have turned her beautiful home into a clearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
house for Red Cross workers. “It is all I can
do. I am quite alone now, and it cheers me and
gives me new topics of interest to see and care for
the splendid girls who are really going over there
to help our soldiers.”
</p>
<p>
Later Ruth Fielding learned that this woman’s
two sons were both in France—one in a medical
corps and the other in the trenches. She had already
given her all, it seemed; but she could not
do too much for the country.
</p>
<p>
The several girls the lady entertained at this
time had little opportunity for amusement. The
Red Cross ship was to sail within forty-eight
hours.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was able to meet many of the members
of her supply unit, and found them a most interesting
group. They had come from many parts
of the country and had brought with them varied
ideas about the work and of what they were “going
up against.”
</p>
<p>
All, however, seemed to be deeply interested
in the Red Cross and the burden the war had laid
upon them. They were not going to France to
play, but to serve in any way possible.
</p>
<p>
There was a single disturbing element in the
bustling hurry of getting under way. At this late
moment the woman who had been chosen as chief
of the supply unit was deterred from sailing. Serious
illness in her family forced her to resign her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
position and remain to nurse those at home. It
was quite a blow to the unit and to the Commissioner
himself.
</p>
<p>
The question, Who will take her place? became
the most important thought in the minds of the
members of the unit. Ruth fully understood that
to find a person as capable as the woman already
selected would not be an easy matter.
</p>
<p>
Until the hour the party left New York for
Philadelphia, the port of sail for the Red Cross
ship, no candidate had been settled on by the Commissioner
to head the supply unit.
</p>
<p>
“We shall find somebody. I have one person
in mind right now who may be the very one. If
so, this person will be shipped by a faster vessel
and by another convoy than yours,” and he
laughed. “You may find your chief in Paris when
you get there.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth wondered to herself if they really would
get there. At this time the German submarines
were sinking even the steamships taking Red
Cross workers and supplies across. The Huns
had thrown over their last vestige of humanity.
</p>
<p>
The ship which carried the Red Cross units
joined a squadron of other supply ships outside
Cape May. The guard ships were a number of
busy and fast sailing torpedo boat destroyers.
They darted around the slower flotilla of merchant
steamships like “lucky-bugs” on a millpond.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth shared her outside cabin with a girl from
Topeka, Kansas—an exceedingly blithe and boisterous
young person.
</p>
<p>
“I never imagined there was so much water in
the ocean!” declared this young woman, Clare
Biggars. “Look at it! Such a perfectly awful
waste of it. If the ocean is just a means of communication
between countries, it needn’t be any
wider than the Missouri River, need it?”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad the Atlantic is a good deal wider
than that,” Ruth said seriously. “The Kaiser and
his armies would have been over in our country
before this in that case.”
</p>
<p>
Clare chuckled. “Lots of the farming people
in my section are Germans, and three months ago
they noised it abroad that New York had been
attacked by submarines and flying machines and
that a big army of their fellow-countrymen were
landing in this country at a place called Montauk
Point——”
</p>
<p>
“The end of Long Island,” interposed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“And were going to march inland and conquer
the country as they marched. They would do to
New York State just what they have done to Belgium
and Northern France. It was thought, by
their talk, that all the Germans around Topeka
would rise and seize the banks and arsenals and
all.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t they?” asked Ruth, much amused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Clare, laughing, too, “the police
wouldn’t let them.”
</p>
<p>
The German peril by sea, however, was not to
be sneered at. As the fleet approached the
coast of France it became evident that the officers
of the Red Cross ship, as well as those of the convoy,
were in much anxiety.
</p>
<p>
There seems no better way to safeguard the
merchant ships than for the destroyers to sail
ahead and “clear the way” for the unarmored
vessels. But a sharp submarine commander may
spy the coming flotilla through his periscope, sink
deep to allow the destroyers to pass over him, and
then rise to the surface between the destroyers
and the larger ships and torpedo the latter before
the naval vessels can attack the subsea boat.
</p>
<p>
For forty-eight hours none of the girls of the
Red Cross supply unit had their clothing off or
went to bed. They were advised to buckle on life
preservers, and most of them remained on deck,
watching for submarines. It was scarcely possible
to get them below for meals.
</p>
<p>
The strain of the situation was great. And yet
it was more excitement over the possibility of being
attacked than actual fear.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use of going across the pond at
such a time if we’re not even to see a periscope?”
demanded Clare. “My brother, Ben, who is coming
over with the first expedition of the National
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
Army, wagered me ten dollars I wouldn’t know
a periscope if I saw one. I’d like to earn that
ten. Every little bit adds to what you’ve got, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
It was not the sight of a submarine periscope
that startled Ruth Fielding the evening of the
next-to-the-last day of the voyage. It was something
she heard as she leaned upon the port rail
on the main deck, quite alone, looking off across
the graying water.
</p>
<p>
Two people were behind her, and out of sight
around the corner of the deckhouse. One was a
man, with a voice that had a compelling bark.
Whether his companion was a man or a woman
Ruth could not tell. But the voice she heard so
distinctly began to rasp her nerves—and its familiarity
troubled her, too.
</p>
<p>
Now and then she heard a word in English.
Then, of a sudden, the man ejaculated in German:
</p>
<p>
“The foolish ones! As though this boat would
be torpedoed with us aboard! These Americans
are crazy.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth wheeled and walked quickly down the
deck to the corner of the house. She saw the
speaker sitting in a deck chair beside another person
who was so wrapped in deck rugs that she could
not distinguish what he or she looked
like.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
But the silhouette of the man who had uttered
those last words stood out plainly between Ruth
and the fading light. He was tall, with heavy
shoulders, and a fat, beefy face. That smoothly
shaven countenance looked like nobody that she
had ever seen before; but the barking voice
sounded exactly like that of Legrand, Mrs. Rose
Mantel’s associate and particular friend!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—THROUGH DANGEROUS WATERS</h2>
<p>
There were a number of people aboard ship
whom Ruth Fielding had not met, of course; some
whom she had not even seen. And this was not
to be wondered at, for the feminine members of
the supply unit were grouped together in a certain
series of staterooms; and they even had their
meals in a second cabin saloon away from the
hospital units.
</p>
<p>
She looked, for some moments, at the huge
shoulders of the man who had spoken in German,
hoping he would turn to face her. She had not
observed him since coming aboard the ship at
Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
It seemed scarcely possible that this could be
Legrand, the man who she had come to believe
was actually responsible for the fire in the Robinsburg
Red Cross rooms. If he was a traitor to
the organization—and to the United States as
well—how dared he sail on this ship for France,
and with an organization of people who were
sworn to work for the Red Cross?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
Was he sufficiently disguised by the shaving of
his beard to risk discovery? And with that peculiar,
sharp, barking voice! “A Prussian drill
master surely could be no more abrupt,” thought
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
As the ship in these dangerous waters sailed
with few lamps burning, and none at all had been
turned on upon the main deck, it was too dark
for Ruth to see clearly either the man who had
spoken or the person hidden by the wraps in the
deck chair.
</p>
<p>
She saw the spotlight in the hand of an officer
up the deck and she hastened toward him. The
passengers were warned not to use the little electric
hand lamps outside of the cabins and passages.
She was not mistaken in the identity of
this person with the lamp. It was the purser.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Savage!” she said. “Will you walk
with me?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me, Miss Fielding! you fill me with delight.
This is an unexpected proposal I am sure,”
he declared in his heavy, English, but good-humored
way.
</p>
<p>
“‘Fash not yoursel’ wi’ pride,’ as Chief Engineer
Douglas would say,” laughed Ruth. “I am
going to ask you to walk with me so that you can
tell me the name of another man I am suddenly
interested in.”
</p>
<p>
“What! What!” cried the purser. “Who is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
that, I’d like to know. Who are you so suddenly
interested in?”
</p>
<p>
She tried to explain the appearance of the
round-shouldered man as she led the purser along
the deck. But when they reached the spot where
Ruth had left the individuals both had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whom you could have seen,” the
purser said, “unless it was Professor Perry. His
stateroom is yonder—A-thirty-four. And the little
chap in the deck chair might be Signor Aristo,
an Italian, who rooms next door, in thirty-six.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not sure it was a man in the other chair.”
</p>
<p>
“Professor Perry has nothing to do with the ladies
aboard, I assure you,” chuckled the purser.
“A dry-as-dust old fellow, Perry, going to France
for some kind of research work. Comes from one
of your Western universities. I believe they have
one in every large town, haven’t they?”
</p>
<p>
“One what?” Ruth asked.
</p>
<p>
“University,” chuckled the Englishman. “You
should get acquainted with Perry, if his appearance
so much interests you, Miss Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth was in no mood for banter about the
man whose appearance and words had so astonished
her. She said nothing to the purser or to
anybody else about what she had heard the
strange man say in German. No person who belonged—really
<em>belonged</em>—on this Red Cross ship,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
should have said what he did and in that tone!
</p>
<p>
He spoke to his companion as though there was
a settled and secret understanding between them.
And as though, too, he had a power of divination
about what the German U-boat commanders
would do, beyond the knowledge possessed by the
officers of the steamship.
</p>
<p>
What could a “dry-as-dust” professor from a
Western university have in common with the person
known as Signor Aristo, who Ruth found was
down on the ship’s list as a chef of a wealthy Fifth
Avenue family, going back to his native Italy.
</p>
<p>
It was said the Signor had had a very bad
passage. He had kept to his room entirely, not
even appearing on deck. <em>Was he a man at all?</em>
</p>
<p>
The thought came to Ruth Fielding and would
not be put away, that this small, retiring person
known as Signor Aristo might be a woman. If
Professor Perry was the distinguished Legrand
what was more possible than that the person Ruth
had seen in the deck chair was Mrs. Rose Mantel,
likewise in disguise?
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” she told herself at last, “I am
getting to be a regular sleuth. But my suspicions
do point that way. If that woman in black and
Legrand robbed the Red Cross treasury at Robinsburg,
and covered their stealings by burning the
records, would they be likely to leave the country
in a Red Cross ship?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“That would seem preposterous. And yet,
what more unlikely method of departure? It
might be that such a course on the part of two
criminals would be quite sure to cover their escape.”
</p>
<p>
She wondered about it much as the ship sailed
majestically into the French port, safe at last from
any peril of being torpedoed by the enemy. And
Professor Perry had been quite sure that she was
safe in any case!
</p>
<p>
Ruth saw the professor when they landed. The
Italian chef she did not see at all. Nor did Ruth
Fielding see anybody who looked like Mrs. Rose
Mantel.
</p>
<p>
“I may be quite wrong in all my suspicions,”
she thought. “I would better say nothing about
them. To cause the authorities to arrest entirely
innocent people would be a very wicked thing, indeed.”
</p>
<p>
Besides, there was so much to do and to see
that the girl of the Red Mill could not keep her
suspicions alive. This unknown world she and
her mates had come to quite filled their minds with
new thoughts and interests.
</p>
<p>
Their first few hours in France was an experience
long to be remembered. Ruth might have
been quite bewildered had it not been that her
mind was so set upon the novel sights and sounds
about her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“I declare I don’t know whether I am a-foot or
a-horseback!” Clare Biggars said. “Let me hang
on to your coat-tail, Ruth. I know you are real
and United Statesy. But these funny French
folk——
</p>
<p>
“My! they are like people out of a story book,
after all, aren’t they? I thought I’d seen most
every kind of folk at the San Francisco Fair; but
just nobody seems familiar looking here!”
</p>
<p>
Before they were off the quay, several French women,
who could not speak a word of English
save “’Ello!” welcomed the Red Cross workers
with joy. At this time Americans coming to help
France against her enemies were a new and very
wonderful thing. The first marching soldiers
from America were acclaimed along the streets
and country roads as heroes might have been.
</p>
<p>
An old woman in a close-fitting bonnet and
ragged shawl—not an over-clean person—took
Ruth’s hand in both hers and patted it, and said
something in her own tongue that brought the
tears to the girl’s eyes. It was such a blessing as
Aunt Alvirah had murmured over her when the
girl had left the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
She and Clare, with several of the other feminine
members of the supply unit were quartered
in an old hotel almost on the quay for their first
night ashore. It was said that some troop trains
had the right-of-way; so the Red Cross workers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
could not go up to Paris for twenty-four hours.
</p>
<p>
Somebody made a mistake. It could not be expected
that everything would go smoothly. The
heads of the various Red Cross units were not
infallible. Besides, this supply unit to which Ruth
belonged really had no head as yet. The party
at the seaside hotel was forgotten.
</p>
<p>
Nobody came to the hotel to inform them when
the unit was to entrain. They were served very
well by the hotel attendants and several chatty
ladies, who could speak English, came to see them.
But Ruth and the other girls had not come to
France as tourists.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the girl of the Red Mill, with Clare
Biggars, sallied forth to find the remainder of
their unit. Fortunately, Ruth’s knowledge of the
language was not superficial. Madame Picolet,
her French teacher at Briarwood Hall, had been
most thorough in the drilling of her pupils; and
Madame was a Parisienne.
</p>
<p>
But when Ruth discovered that she and her
friends at the seaside hotel had been left behind
by the rest of the Red Cross contingent, she was
rather startled, and Clare was angered.
</p>
<p>
“What do they think we are?” demanded the
Western girl. “Of no account at all? Where’s
our transportation? What do they suppose we’ll
do, dumped down here in this fishing town?
What——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“Whoa! Whoa!” Ruth laughed. “Don’t lose
your temper, my dear,” she advised soothingly.
“If nothing worse than this happens to us——”
</p>
<p>
She immediately interviewed several railroad
officials, arranged for transportation, got the passports
of all viséed, and, in the middle of the afternoon,
they were off by slow train to the French
capital.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t really get lost, girls,” Ruth declared.
“For we are Americans, and Americans, at present,
in France, are objects of considerable interest
to everybody. We’ll only be a day late getting to
the city on the Seine.”
</p>
<p>
When they finally arrived in Paris, Ruth knew
right where to go to reach the Red Cross supply
department headquarters. She had it all written
down in her notebook, and taxicabs brought the
party in safety to the entrance to the building in
question.
</p>
<p>
As the girls alighted from the taxis Clare seized
Ruth’s wrist, whispering:
</p>
<p>
“Why! there’s that Professor Perry again—the
one that came over with us on the steamer.
You remember?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth saw the man whose voice was like Legrand’s,
but whose facial appearance was nothing
at all like that suspected individual. But it was
his companion that particularly attracted the attention
of the girl of the Red Mill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
This was a slight, dark man, who hobbled as he
walked. His right leg was bent and he wore a
shoe with a four-inch wooden sole.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that, I wonder?” Ruth murmured,
looking at the crippled man.
</p>
<p>
“That is Signor Aristo,” Clair said. “He’s
an Italian chef I am told.”
</p>
<p>
Signor Aristo was, likewise, smoothly shaven;
but Ruth remarked that he looked much like the
Mexican, José, who had worked with Legrand at
the Red Cross rooms in Robinsburg.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—THE NEW CHIEF</h2>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was troubled by her most recent
discovery. Yet she was in no mind to take
Clare into her confidence—or anybody else.
</p>
<p>
She was cautious. With nothing but suspicions
to report to the Red Cross authorities, what could
she really say? What, after all, do suspicions
amount to?
</p>
<p>
If the man calling himself Professor Perry
was really Legrand, and the Italian chef, Signor
Aristo the lame man, was he who had been known
as Mr. José at the Robinsburg Red Cross headquarters,
her identification of them must be corroborated.
How could she prove such assertions?
</p>
<p>
It was a serious situation; but one in which Ruth
felt that her hands were tied. She must wait for
something to turn up that would give her a sure
hold on these people whom she believed to be
out and out crooks.
</p>
<p>
Ruth accompanied the remainder of the “left
behind” party of workers into the building, and
they found the proper office in which to report
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
their arrival in Paris. The other members of the
supply unit met the delayed party with much hilarity;
the joke of their having been left behind
was not soon to be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
The hospital units, better organized, and with
their heads, or chiefs, already trained and on the
spot, went on toward the front that very day. But
Ruth’s battalion still lacked a leader. They were
scattered among different hotels and pensions in
the vicinity of the Red Cross offices, and spent several
days in comparative idleness.
</p>
<p>
It gave the girls an opportunity of going about
and seeing the French capital, which, even in wartime,
had a certain amount of gayety. Ruth
searched out Madame Picolet, and Madame was
transported with joy on seeing her one-time pupil.
</p>
<p>
The Frenchwoman held the girl of the Red
Mill in grateful remembrance, and for more than
Ruth’s contribution to Madame Picolet’s work
among the widows and orphans of her dear poilus.
In “Ruth Fielding at Briarwood Hall,” Madame
Picolet’s personal history is narrated, and
how Ruth had been the means of aiding the lady
in a very serious predicament is shown.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, my dear child!” exclaimed the Frenchwoman,
“it is a blessing of <em>le bon Dieu</em> that we
should meet again. And in this, my own country!
I love all Americans for what they are doing
for our poor poilus. Your sweet and volatile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
friend, Helen, is here. She has gone with her
father just now to a southern city. And even that
mischievous Mam’zelle Stone is working in a good
cause. She will be delight’ to see you, too.”
</p>
<p>
This was quite true. Jennie Stone welcomed
Ruth in the headquarters of the American
Women’s League with a scream of joy, and flew
into the arms of the girl of the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
The latter staggered under the shock. Jennie
looked at her woefully.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Don’t</em> tell me that work agrees with me!” she
wailed. “<em>Don’t</em> say that I am getting fat again!
It’s the cooking.”
</p>
<p>
“What cooking? French cooking will never
make you fat in a hundred years,” declared Ruth,
who had had her own experiences in the French
hotels in war times. “Don’t tell me that, Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t. It’s the diet kitchen. I’m in that,
you know, and I’m tasting food all the time. It—it’s
<em>dreadful</em> the amount I manage to absorb
without thinking every day. I know, before this
war is over, I shall be as big as one of those British
tanks they talk about.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, girl!” cried Ruth. “You don’t
have to make a tank of yourself, do you? Exercise——”
</p>
<p>
“Now stop right there, Ruth Fielding!” cried
Jennie Stone, with flashing eyes. “You have as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
little sense as the rest of these people. They tell
me to exercise, and don’t you know that every
time I go horseback riding, or do anything else
of a violent nature, that I have to come right back
and eat enough victuals to put on twice the number
of pounds the exercise is supposed to take off?
Don’t—tell—me! It’s impossible to reduce and
keep one’s health.”
</p>
<p>
Jennie was doing something besides putting on
flesh, however. Her practical work in the diet
kitchen Ruth saw was worthy, indeed.
</p>
<p>
The girl of the Red Mill could not see Helen
at this time, but she believed her chum and Mr.
Cameron would look her up, wherever the supply
unit to which Ruth belonged was ultimately assigned.
</p>
<p>
She received a letter from Tom Cameron about
this time, too, and found that he was hard at work
in a camp right behind the French lines and had
already made one step in the line of progress,
being now a first lieutenant. He expected, with
his force of Pershing’s boys, to go into the
trenches for the first time within a fortnight.
</p>
<p>
She wished she might see Tom again before his
battalion went into action; but she was under command
of the Red Cross; and, in any case, she could
not have got her passport viséed for the front.
Mr. Cameron, as a representative of the United
States Government, with Helen, had been able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
to visit Tom in the training camp over here.
</p>
<p>
Ruth wrote, however—wrote a letter that Tom
slipped into the little leather pouch he wore inside
his shirt, and which he would surely have with him
when he endured his first round of duty in the
trenches. With the verities of life and death so
near to them, these young people were very serious,
indeed.
</p>
<p>
Yet the note of cheerfulness was never lost
among the workers of the Red Cross with whom
Ruth Fielding daily associated. While she waited
for her unit to be assigned to its place the girl of
the Red Mill did not waste her time. There
was always something to see and something to
learn.
</p>
<p>
When congregated at the headquarters of the
Supply Department one day, the unit was suddenly
notified that their new chief had arrived. They
gathered quickly in the reception room and soon
a number of Red Cross officials entered, headed
by one in a major’s uniform and with several
medals on the breast of his coat. He was a medical
army officer in addition to being a Red Cross
commissioner.
</p>
<p>
“The ladies of our new base supply unit,” said
the commissioner, introducing the workers, “already
assigned to Lyse. That was decided last
evening.
</p>
<p>
“And it is my pleasure,” he added, “to introduce to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
you ladies your new chief. She has come
over especially to take charge of your unit. Madame
Mantel, ladies. Her experience, her executive
ability, and her knowledge of French makes
her quite the right person for the place. I know
you will welcome her warmly.”
</p>
<p>
Even before he spoke Ruth Fielding had recognized
the woman in black. Nor did she feel any
overwhelming surprise at Rose Mantel’s appearance.
It was as though the girl had expected,
back in her mind, something like this to happen.
</p>
<p>
The man who spoke like Legrand and the one
who looked like José, appearing at the Paris Red
Cross offices, had prepared Ruth for this very
thing. “Madame” Mantel had crossed the path
of the girl of the Red Mill again. Ruth crowded
behind her companions and hid herself from the
sharp and “snaky” eyes of the woman in black.
</p>
<p>
The question of how Mrs. Mantel had obtained
this place under the Red Cross did not trouble
Ruth at all. She had gained it. The thing that
made Ruth feel anxious was the object the woman
in black had in obtaining her prominent position
in the organization.
</p>
<p>
The girl could not help feeling that there was
something crooked about Rose Mantel, about Legrand,
and about José. These three had, she believed,
robbed the organization in Robinsburg.
Their “pickings” there had perhaps been small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
beside the loot they could obtain with the woman
in black as chief of a base supply unit.
</p>
<p>
Her first experience with Mrs. Mantel in Cheslow
had convinced Ruth Fielding that the woman
was dishonest. The incident of the fire at Robinsburg
seemed to prove this belief correct. Yet how
could she convince the higher authorities of the
Red Cross that the new chief of this supply unit
was a dangerous person?
</p>
<p>
At least, Ruth was not minded to face Mrs.
Mantel at this time. She managed to keep out
of the woman’s way while they remained in Paris.
In two days the unit got their transportation for
Lyse, and it was not until they were well settled
in their work at the base hospital in that city that
Ruth Fielding came in personal contact with the
woman in black, her immediate superior.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had charge of the linen department and
had taken over the supplies before speaking with
Mrs. Mantel. They met in one of the hospital
corridors—and quite suddenly.
</p>
<p>
The woman in black, who still dressed so that
this nickname was borne out by her appearance,
halted in amazement, and Ruth saw her hand go
swiftly to her bosom—was it to still her heart’s
increased beat, or did she hide some weapon
there? The malevolent flash of Rose Mantel’s
eyes easily suggested the latter supposition.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Fielding!” she gasped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“How do you do, Mrs. Mantel?” the girl of
the Red Mill returned quietly.
</p>
<p>
“How—— I had no idea you had come
across. And in my unit?”
</p>
<p>
“I was equally surprised when I discovered
you, Mrs. Mantel,” said the girl.
</p>
<p>
“You—— How odd!” murmured the woman
in black. “Quite a coincidence. I had not seen
you since the fire——”
</p>
<p>
“And I hope there will be no fire here—don’t
you, Madame Mantel?” interrupted Ruth.
“That would be too dreadful.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right. Quite too dreadful,” agreed
Mrs. Mantel, and swept past the girl haughtily.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—A CHANGE OF BASE</h2>
<p>
Ruth’s daily tasks did not often bring her into
contact with the chief of her unit. This was a
very large hospital—one of the most extensive
base hospitals in France. There were thousands
of dollars’ worth of supplies in Ruth’s single department.
</p>
<p>
At present the American Red Cross at this
point was caring for French and Canadian
wounded. As the American forces came over,
were developed into fighting men, and were
brought back from the battlefield hospitals as
<em>grands blessés</em>, as the French call the more seriously
wounded, this base would finally handle
American wounded only.
</p>
<p>
Ruth went through some of the wards in her
spare hours, for she had become acquainted with
several of the nurses coming over. The appeal
of the helpless men (some of them blinded)
wrenched the tender heart of the girl of the Red
Mill as nothing she had ever before experienced.
</p>
<p>
She found that in her off hours she could be of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
use in the hospital wards. So many of the patients
wished to write home, but could do so only
through the aid of the Red Cross workers. This
task Ruth could perform, for she could write and
speak French.
</p>
<p>
Nobody interfered with her when she undertook
these extra tasks. She saw that many of the
girls in her own unit kept away from the wards
because the sight of the wounded and crippled
men was hard to bear. Even Clare Biggars had
other uses for her spare moments than writing letters
for helpless <em>blessés</em>.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was not forced into contact with the chief
of her unit, and was glad thereof. Her weekly
reports went up to Madame Mantel, and that was
quite all Ruth had to do with the woman in
black.
</p>
<p>
But the girl heard her mates talking a good
deal about the woman. The latter seemed to be
a favorite with most of the unit. Clare Biggars
quite “raved” about Madame Mantel.
</p>
<p>
“And she knows so many nice people!” Clare
exclaimed. “I wish my French was better. I
went to dinner last night with Madame Mantel at
that little café of the Chou-rouge. Half the people
there seemed to know her. And Professor
Perry——”
</p>
<p>
“Not the man who came over on the steamer
with us?” Ruth asked with sudden anxiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“The very same,” said Clare. “He ate at our
table.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t suppose that little Italian chef, Signor
Aristo, was among those present, too?” Ruth
asked suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“No. The only Italian I saw was not lame like
Signor Aristo. Madame said he was an Italian
commissioner. He was in uniform.”
</p>
<p>
“Who was in uniform? Aristo?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no! How you talk! The Italian gentleman
at the restaurant. Aristo had a short leg,
don’t you remember? This man was dressed in
an Italian uniform—all red and green, and medals
upon his coat.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I will go to the Chou-rouge myself,”
Ruth said dryly. “It must be quite a popular
place. But I hope they serve something to eat besides
the red cabbage the name signifies.”
</p>
<p>
Again her suspicions were aroused to fever
heat. If Professor Perry was Legrand disguised,
he and Mrs. Mantel had got together again. And
Clare’s mention of the Italian added to Ruth’s
trouble of mind, too.
</p>
<p>
José could easily have assumed the heavy shoe
and called himself “Aristo.” Perhaps he was an
Italian, and not a Mexican, after all. The trio
of crooks, if such they were, had not joined each
other here in Lyse by accident. There was something
of a criminal nature afoot, Ruth felt sure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
And yet with what evidence could she go to the
Red Cross authorities?
</p>
<p>
Besides, something occurred to balk her intention
of going to the café of the Chou-rouge to get
a glimpse of the professor and the Italian commissioner.
That day, much to her surprise, the
medical major at the head of the great hospital
sent for the girl of the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Fielding,” he said, upon shaking hands
with her, “you have been recommended to me
very highly as a young woman to fill a certain special
position now open at Clair. Do you mind
leaving your present employment?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,” the girl said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“I think the work at Clair will appeal to you,”
the major continued. “I understand that you
have been working at off hours in the convalescent
wards. That is very commendable.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, several of the other girls have been helping
there as well as I.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not doubt it,” he said with a smile. “But
it is reported to me that your work is especially
commendable. You speak very good French. It
is to a French hospital at Clair I can send you.
A representative of the Red Cross is needed there
to furnish emergency supplies when called upon,
and particularly to communicate with the families
of the <em>blessés</em>, and to furnish special services to
the patients. You have a way with you, I understand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
that pleases the poor fellows and that fits
you for this position of which I speak.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I believe I should like it!” the girl cried,
her eyes glistening. It seemed to be just the work
she had hoped for from the beginning—coming
in personal touch with the wounded. A place
where her sympathies would serve the poor fellows.
</p>
<p>
“The position is yours. You will start to-night,”
declared the major. “Clair is within
sound of the guns. It has been bombarded twice;
but we shall hope the <em>Boches</em> do not get so near
again.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was delighted with the chance to go. But
suddenly a new thought came to her mind. She
asked:
</p>
<p>
“Who recommended me, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“You have the very best recommendation you
could have, Miss Fielding,” he said pleasantly.
“Your chief seems to think very highly of your
capabilities. Madame Mantel suggested your appointment.”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the major was not looking at Ruth
as he spoke, but was filling out her commission
papers for the new place she had accepted. The
girl’s emotion at that moment was too great to be
wholly hidden.
</p>
<p>
Rose Mantel to recommend her for any position!
It seemed unbelievable! Unless——
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
The thought came to Ruth that the woman in
black wished her out of the way. She feared the
girl might say something regarding the Robinsburg
fire that would start an official inquiry here
in France regarding Mrs. Mantel and her particular
friends. Was that the basis for the woman in
black’s desire to get Ruth out of the way? Should
the latter tell this medical officer, here and now,
just what she thought of Mrs. Mantel?
</p>
<p>
How crass it would sound in his ears if she did
so! Rose Mantel had warmly recommended
Ruth for a position that the girl felt was just what
she wanted.
</p>
<p>
She could not decide before the major handed
her the papers and an order for transportation in
an ambulance going to Clair. He again shook
hands with her. His abrupt manner showed that
he was a busy man and that he had no more time
to give to her affairs.
</p>
<p>
“Get your passport viséed before you start.
Never neglect your passport over here in these
times,” advised the major.
</p>
<p>
Should she speak? She hesitated, and the
major sat down to his desk and took up his pen
again.
</p>
<p>
“Good-day, Miss Fielding,” he said. “And the
best of luck!”
</p>
<p>
The girl left the office, still in a hesitating frame
of mind. There were yet several hours before she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
left the town. Her bags were quickly packed.
All the workers of the Red Cross “traveled light,”
as Clare Biggars laughingly said.
</p>
<p>
Ruth decided that she could not confide in
Clare. Already the Western girl was quite enamored
of the smiling, snaky Rose Mantel. It would
be useless to ask Clare to watch the woman. Nor
could Ruth feel that it would be wise to go to the
French police and tell them of her suspicions concerning
the woman in black.
</p>
<p>
The French have a very high regard for the
American Red Cross—as they have for their own
<em>Croix Rouge</em>. They can, and do, accept assistance
for their needy poilus and for others from
the American Red Cross, because, in the end, the
organization is international and is not affiliated
with any particular religious sect.
</p>
<p>
To accuse one of the Red Cross workers in this
great hospital at Lyse would be very serious—no
matter to what Ruth’s suspicions pointed. The
girl could not bring herself to do that.
</p>
<p>
When she went to the prefect of police to have
her passport viséed she found a white-mustached,
fatherly man, who took a great interest in her as
an <em>Americaine mademoiselle</em> who had come across
the ocean to aid France.
</p>
<p>
“I kiss your hand, Mademoiselle!” he said.
“Your bravery and your regard for my country
touches me deeply. Good fortune attend your efforts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
at Clair. You may be under bombardment
there, my child. It is possible. We shall hope for
your safety.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth thanked him for his good wishes, and,
finally, was tempted to give some hint of her fears
regarding the supposed Professor Perry and the
Italian Clare had spoken of.
</p>
<p>
“They may be perfectly straightforward people,”
Ruth said; “but where I was engaged in Red
Cross work in America these two men—I am almost
sure they are the same—worked under the
names of Legrand and José, one supposedly a
Frenchman and the other a Mexican. There was
a fire and property was destroyed. Legrand and
José were suspected in the matter, but I believe
they got away without being arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“Mademoiselle, you put me under further obligations,”
declared the police officer. “I shall
make it my business to look up these two men—and
their associates.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Monsieur, I may be wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“If it is proved that they are in disguise, that is
sufficient. We are giving spies short shrift nowadays.”
</p>
<p>
His stern words rather troubled Ruth. Yet
she believed she had done her duty in announcing
her suspicions of the two men. Of Rose Mantel
she said nothing. If the French prefect made a
thorough investigation, as he should, he could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
fail to discover the connection between the men
and the chief of the Red Cross supply unit at the
hospital.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s arrangements were made in good season,
and Clare and the other girls bade her a warm
good-bye at the door of their pension. The ambulance
that was going to Clair proved to be an
American car of famous make with an ambulance
body, and driven by a tall, thin youth who wore
shell-bowed glasses. He was young and gawky
and one could see hundreds of his like leaving the
city high schools in America at half-past three
o’clock, or pacing the walks about college campuses.
</p>
<p>
He looked just as much out of place in the
strenuous occupation of ambulance driver as anyone
could look. He seemingly was a “bookish”
young man who would probably enjoy hunting a
Greek verb to its lair. Tom Cameron would have
called him “a plug”—a term meaning an over-faithful
student.
</p>
<p>
Ruth climbed into the seat beside this driver.
She then had no more than time to wave her hand
to the girls before the ambulance shot away from
the curb, turned a corner on two wheels, and, with
the staccato blast of a horn that sounded bigger
than the car itself, sent dogs and pedestrians flying
for their lives.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” gasped Ruth when she caught her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
breath. Then she favored the bespectacled driver
with a surprised stare. He looked straight ahead,
and, as they reached the edge of the town, he put
on still more speed, and the girl began to learn
why people who can afford it buy automobiles that
have good springs and shock absorbers.
</p>
<p>
“Do—do you <em>have</em> to drive this way?” she
finally shrilled above the clatter of the car.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. This is the best road—and that isn’t
saying much,” the bespectacled driver declared.
</p>
<p>
“No! I mean so fa-a-ast!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Does it jar you? I’ll pull her down.
Got so used to getting over all the ground I can
before I break something—or a shell comes——”
</p>
<p>
He reduced speed until they could talk to each
other. Ruth learned all in one gush, it seemed,
that his name was Charlie Bragg, that he had been
on furlough, and that they had given him a “new
second-hand flivver” to take up to Clair and beyond,
as his old machine had been quite worn
out.
</p>
<p>
He claimed unsmilingly to be more than twenty-one,
that he had left a Western college in the middle
of his freshman year to come over to drive a
Red Cross car, and that he was writing a book to
be called “On the Battlefront with a Flivver,” in
which his brother in New York already had a publisher
interested.
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” said this boy-man, who simply amazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
Ruth Fielding, “Bob’s ten years older than I am,
and he’s married, and his wife makes him put on
rubbers and take an umbrella if it rains when he
starts for his office. And they used to call me
‘Bubby’ before I came over here.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth could appreciate that! She laughed and
they became better friends.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—NEW WORK</h2>
<p>
The prefect of police at Lyse was quite right.
Clair was within sound of the big guns. Indeed,
Ruth became aware of their steady monotone long
before the rattling car reached its destination.
</p>
<p>
As the first hour sped by and the muttering of
the guns came nearer and nearer, the girl asked
Charlie Bragg if there was danger of one of the
projectiles, that she began faintly to hear explode
individually, coming their way. Was not this
road a perilous one?
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, ma’am!” he declared. “Oh, yes, this
road has been bombarded more than once. Don’t
you notice how crooked it is? We turn out for
the shell holes and make a new road, that’s all.
But there’s no danger.”
</p>
<p>
“But aren’t you frightened at all—ever?”
murmured the girl of the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
“What is there to be afraid of?” asked the boy,
whom his family called “Bubby.” “If they get
you they get you, and that’s all there is to it.
</p>
<p>
“We have to stop here and put the lights out,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
he added, seeing a gaunt post beside the road on
which was a half-obliterated sign.
</p>
<p>
“If you have to do that it must be perilous,”
declared Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“No. It’s just an order. Maybe they’ve forgotten
to take the sign down. But I don’t want
to be stopped by one of these old territorials—or
even by one of our own military police. You
don’t know when you’re likely to run into one of
them. Or maybe it’s a marine. Those are the
boys, believe me! They’re on the job first and
always.”
</p>
<p>
“But this time you boys who came to France to
run automobiles got ahead of even the marine
corps,” laughed Ruth. “Oh! What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
They were then traveling a very dark bit of
road. Right across the gloomy way and just
ahead of the machine something white dashed
past. It seemed to cross the road in two or three
great leaps and then sailed over the hedge on the
left into a field.
</p>
<p>
“Did you see it?” asked Charlie Bragg, and
there was a queer shake in his voice.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what is it? There it goes—all white!”
and the excited girl pointed across the field, half
standing up in the rocking car to do so.
</p>
<p>
“Going for the lines,” said the young driver.
</p>
<p>
“Is it a dog? A big dog? And he didn’t bark
or anything!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never does bark,” said her companion.
“They say they can’t bark.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it’s a wolf! Wolves don’t bark,” Ruth
suggested.
</p>
<p>
“I guess that’s right. They say they are dumb.
Gosh! I don’t know,” Charlie said. “You didn’t
really see anything, did you?” and he said it so
very oddly that Ruth Fielding was perfectly
amazed.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by that?” she demanded.
“I saw just as much as you did.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m not sure that I saw anything,” he
told her slowly. “The French say it’s the werwolf—and
that means just nothing at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” exclaimed Ruth, repeating the
word. “What old-world superstition is that?
The ghost of a wolf?”
</p>
<p>
“They have a story that certain people, selling
themselves to the Devil, can change at will into the
form of a wolf,” went on Charlie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know! They have that legend in every
language there is, I guess,” Ruth returned.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve said it!”
</p>
<p>
“How ridiculous that sounds—in this day and
generation. You don’t mean that people around
here believe such stories?”
</p>
<p>
“They do.”
</p>
<p>
“And you half believe it yourself, Mr. Bragg,”
cried Ruth, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“I tell you what it is,” the young fellow said
earnestly, while still guiding the car through the
dark way with a skill that was really wonderful.
“There are a whole lot of things I don’t know in
this world. I didn’t used to think so; but I do
now.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t believe in magic—either black
or white?”
</p>
<p>
“I know that that thing you saw just now—and
that I have seen twice before—flies through this
country just like that, and at night. It never
makes a sound. Soldiers have shot at it, and
either missed—or their bullets go right through
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how absurd!”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it?” and perhaps Charlie Bragg grinned.
But he went on seriously enough: “I don’t know.
I’m only telling you what they say. If it is a white
or gray dog, it leaps the very trenches and barbed-wire
entanglements on the front—so they say. It
has been seen doing so. No one has been able
to shoot it. It crosses what they call No Man’s
Land between the two battlefronts.”
</p>
<p>
“It carries despatches to the Germans, then!”
cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“That is what the military authorities say,”
said Charlie. “But these peasants don’t believe
that. They say the werwolf was here long before
the war. There is a chateau over back here—not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
far from the outskirts of Clair. The people say
that <em>the woman</em> lives there.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean—the woman?” asked
Ruth, between jounces, as the car took a particularly
rough piece of the road on high gear.
</p>
<p>
“The one who is the werwolf,” said Charlie,
and he tried to laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Bragg!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m only telling you what they say,” he
explained. “Lots of funny things are happening
in this war. But <em>this</em> began before August, nineteen-fourteen,
according to their tell.”
</p>
<p>
“Whose tell? And what other ‘funny’ things
do you believe have happened?” the girl asked,
with some scorn.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right,” he declared more stoutly.
“When you’ve been here as long as I have you’ll
begin to wonder if there isn’t something in all
these things you hear tell of. Why, don’t you
know that fifty per cent, at least, of the French
people—poilus and all—believe that the spirit of
Joan of Arc led them to victory against the Boches
in the worst battle of all?”
</p>
<p>
“I have heard something of that,” Ruth admitted
quietly. “But that does not make me believe
in werwolves.”
</p>
<p>
“No. But you should hear old Gaston Pere
tell about this dog, or wolf, or ghost, or whatever
it is. Gaston keeps the toll-bridge just this side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
of Clair. You’ll likely see him to-night. He told
me all about the woman.”
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake, Mr. Bragg!” gasped Ruth.
“Tell me more. You have got my feelings all
harrowed up. You can’t possibly believe in such
things—not really?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m only saying what Gaston—and others—say.
This woman is a very great lady. A countess.
She is an Alsatian—but not the right kind.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by that?” interrupted
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“All Alsatians are not French at heart,” said
the young man. “This French count married her
years ago. She has two sons and both are in the
French army. But it is said that she has had influence
enough to keep them off the battle front.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it sounds queer, and crazy, and all!” he
added, with sudden vehemence. “But you saw
that white thing flashing by yourself. It is never
seen save at night, and always coming or going
between the chateau and the battle lines, or between
the lines themselves—out there in No Man’s
Land.
</p>
<p>
“It used to race the country roads in the same
direction—only as far as the then frontier—before
the war. So they say. Months before the
Germans spilled over into this country. There
you have it.
</p>
<p>
“The military authorities believe it is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
despatch-carrying dog. The peasants say the old
countess is a werwolf. She keeps herself shut in
the chateau with only a few servants. The military
authorities can get nothing on her, and the
peasants cross themselves when they pass her
gate.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth said nothing for a minute or two. The
guns grew louder in her ears, and the car came
down a slight hill to the edge of a river. Here
was the toll-bridge, and an old man came out with
a shrouded lantern to take toll—and to look at
their papers, too, for he was an official.
</p>
<p>
“Good evening, Gaston,” said Charlie Bragg.
</p>
<p>
“Evening, Monsieur,” was the cheerful reply.
</p>
<p>
The American lad stooped over his wheel to
whisper: “Gaston! the werwolf just crossed the
road three miles or so back, going toward——”
and he nodded in the direction of the grumbling
guns.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Ma foi!</em>” exclaimed the old man. “It forecasts
another bombardment or air attack. Ah-h!
La-la!”
</p>
<p>
He sighed, nodded to Ruth, and stepped back
to let the car go on. The girl felt as though she
were growing superstitious herself. This surely
was a new and strange world she had come to—and
a new and strange experience.
</p>
<p>
“Do you really believe all that?” she finally
asked Charlie Bragg, point-blank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I don’t know what I believe,” he
said. “But you saw the werwolf as well as I.
Now, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw a light-colored dog of large size that ran
across the track we were following,” said Ruth
Fielding decisively, almost fiercely. “I’ll confess
to nothing else.”
</p>
<p>
But she liked Charlie Bragg just the same, and
thanked him warmly when he set her down at the
door of the Clair Hospital just before midnight.
He was going on to the ambulance station, several
miles nearer to the actual front.
</p>
<p>
There were no street lights in Clair and the
windows of the hospital were all shrouded, as well
as those of the dwellings left standing in the town.
Airplanes of the enemy had taken to bombing hospitals
in the work of “frightfulness.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was welcomed by a kindly Frenchwoman,
who was matron, or <em>directrice</em>, and shown to a cell
where she could sleep. Her duties began the next
morning, and it was not long before the girl of
the Red Mill was deeply engaged in this new
work—so deeply engaged, indeed, that she almost
forgot her suspicions about the woman in black,
and Legrand and José, or whatever their real
names were.
</p>
<p>
However, Charlie Bragg’s story of the werwolf,
of the suspected countess in her chateau behind
Clair, and Gaston’s prophecy regarding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
meaning of the ghostly appearance, were not easily
forgotten. Especially, when, two nights following
Ruth’s coming to the hospital, a German
airman dropped several bombs near the institution.
Evidently he was trying to get the range
of the Red Cross hospital.

<p>
Ruth Fielding had already become inured to
the sights and sounds of hospital life at Lyse, and
to its work as well. Of course she was not under
the physical strain that the Red Cross nurses endured;
but her heart was racked by sympathy for
the <em>blessés</em> as greatly as the nurses’ own.
</p>
<p>
Starting without knowing anyone in the big hospital,
she quickly learned her duties, and soon
showed, too, her fitness for the special work assigned
her. Her responsibilities merely included
the arranging of special supplies and keeping the
key of her supply room; but the particular strain
attending her work was connected with the spiritual
needs of the wounded.
</p>
<p>
Their gratitude, she soon found, was a thing to
touch and warm the heart. Fretful they might be,
and as unreasonable as children at times. But in
the last count they were all—even the hardest of
them—grateful for what she could do for them.
</p>
<p>
She had read (who has not?) of the noble sacrifices
of that great woman whose work for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
helpless soldiers in hospital antedates the Red
Cross and its devoted workers—Florence Nightingale.
She knew how the sick and dying soldiers
in the Crimea kissed her shadow on their pillows
as she passed their cots, and blessed her with their
dying breaths.
</p>
<p>
The roughest soldier, wounded unto death,
turns to the thought of mother, of wife, of sweetheart,
of sister—indeed, turns to any good woman
whose voice soothes him, whose hand cools the
fever of his brow.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding began to understand better than
ever before this particular work that she was now
called upon to perform, and that she was so well
fitted to perform.
</p>
<p>
She was cheerful as well as sympathetic; she
was sane beyond most young girls in her management
of men—many men.
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, Mademoiselle!” declared the matron,
“of course they will make love to you. Let
them. It will do them good—the poor <em>blessés</em>—and
do you no harm. And you have a way with
you!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth got over being worried by amatory bouts
with the wounded poilus after a while. Her best
escape was to offer to write letters to the afflicted
one’s wife or sweetheart. That was part of her
work—to attend to as much of the correspondence
of the helplessly wounded as possible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
And all the time she gave sympathy and care
to these strangers she hoped, if Tom Cameron
should chance to be wounded, some woman would
be as kind to him!
</p>
<p>
She had not received a second letter from Tom;
but after a fortnight Mr. Cameron and Helen
came unexpectedly to Clair. Helen spent two
days with her while Mr. Cameron attended to
some important business connected with his mission
in France.
</p>
<p>
They had seen Tom lately, and reported that
the boy had advanced splendidly in his work. Mr.
Cameron declared proudly that his son was a born
soldier.
</p>
<p>
He had already been in the trenches held by
both the French and British to study their methods
of defence and offence. This training all the junior,
as well as senior, officers of the American expeditionary
forces were having, for this was an altogether
new warfare that was being waged on the
shell-swept fields of France and Belgium.
</p>
<p>
Helen had arranged to remain in Paris with
Jennie Stone when her father went back to the
States. She expressed herself as rather horrified
at some of the things she learned Ruth did for
and endured from the wounded men.
</p>
<p>
“Why, they are not at all nice—some of them,”
she objected with a shudder. “That great, black-whiskered
man almost swore in French just now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jean?” laughed Ruth. “I presume he did.
He has terrible wounds, and when they are
dressed he lies with clenched hands and never
utters a groan. But when a man does <em>that</em>, keeping
subdued the natural outlet of pain through
groans and tears, his heart must of necessity,
Helen, become bitter. His irritation spurts forth
like the rain, upon the unjust and the just—upon
the guilty and innocent alike.”
</p>
<p>
“But he should consider what you are doing for
him—how you step out of your life down into
his——”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Up</em> into his, say, rather,” Ruth interrupted,
flushing warmly. “It is true he of the black beard
whom you are taking exception to, is a carter by
trade. But next to him lies a count, and those two
are brothers. Ah, these Frenchmen in this trial
of their patriotism are wonderful, Helen!”
</p>
<p>
“Some of them are very dirty, unpleasant men,”
sighed Helen, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
“You must not speak that way of my children.
Sometimes I feel jealous of the nurses,” said
Ruth, smiling sadly, “because they can do so much
more for them than I. But I can supply them with
some comforts which the nurses cannot.”
</p>
<p>
They were, indeed, like children, these
wounded, for the most part. They called Ruth
“sister” in their tenderest moments; even “maman”
when they were delirious. The touch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
her hand often quieted them when they were feverish.
She read to them when she could. And she
wrote innumerable letters—intimate, family letters
that these wounded men would have shrunk
from having their mates know about.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, too, had to share in all the “news from
home” that came to the more fortunate patients.
She unpacked the boxes sent them, and took care
of such contents as were not at once gobbled down—for
soldiers are inordinately fond of “goodies.”
She had to obey strictly the doctors’ orders about
these articles of diet, however, or some of the
patients would have failed to progress in their
convalescence.
</p>
<p>
Nor were all on the road to recovery; yet the
spirit of cheerfulness was the general tone of even
the “dangerous” cases. Their unshaken belief
was that they would get well and, many of them,
return to their families again.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Chère petite mère</em>,” Louis, the little Paris
tailor, shot through both lungs, whispered to Ruth
as she passed his bed, “see! I have something to
show you. It came to me only to-day in the mail.
Our first—and born since I came away. The very
picture of his mother!”
</p>
<p>
The girl looked, with sympathetic eyes, at the
postcard photograph of a very bald baby. Her
ability to share in their joys and sorrows made her
work here of much value.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“I feel now,” said Louis softly, “that <em>le bon
Dieu</em> will surely let me live—I shall live to see the
child,” and he said it with exalted confidence.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth had already heard the head physician
of the hospital whisper to the nurse that Louis
had no more than twenty-four hours to live. Yet
the poilu’s sublime belief kept him cheerful to the
end.
</p>
<p>
Many, many things the girl of the Red Mill
was learning these days. If they did not exactly
age her, she felt that she could never again take
life so thoughtlessly and lightly. Her girlhood
was behind her; she was facing the verities of existence.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—AT THE GATEWAY OF THE CHATEAU</h2>
<p>
Ruth heard from Clare Biggars and the other
girls at the Lyse Hospital on several occasions;
but little was said in any of their letters regarding
Mrs. Mantel, and, of course, nothing at all of
the woman’s two friends, who Ruth had reason
to suspect were dishonest.
</p>
<p>
She wondered if the prefect of police had
looked up the records of “Professor Perry” and
the Italian commissioner, the latter who, she was
quite sure, could be identified as “Signor Aristo,”
the chef, and again as “José,” who had worked
for the Red Cross at Robinsburg.
</p>
<p>
France was infested, she understood, with spies.
It was whispered that, from highest to lowest, all
grades of society were poisoned by the presence
of German agents.
</p>
<p>
Whether Rose Mantel and her two friends
were actually working for the enemy or not, Ruth
was quite sure they were not whole-heartedly engaged
in efforts for the Red Cross, or for France.
</p>
<p>
However, her heart and hands were so filled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
with hourly duties that Ruth could not give much
thought to the unsavory trio. Rose Mantel, the
woman in black, and the two men Ruth feared and
suspected, must be attended to by the proper authorities.
The girl of the Red Mill had done
quite all that could be expected of her when she
warned the police head at Lyse to be on his
guard.
</p>
<p>
Her work in the hospital and supply room engaged
so much of her time that for the first few
weeks Ruth scarcely found opportunity to exercise
properly. <em>Madame, la Directrice</em>, fairly had
to drive her out of the hospital into the open
air.
</p>
<p>
The fields and lanes about the town were
lovely. Here the Hun had not seized and destroyed
everything of beauty. He had been
driven back too quickly in the early weeks of the
war to have wreaked vengeance upon all that was
French.
</p>
<p>
Clair was the center of a large agricultural
community. The farmers dwelt together in the
town and tilled the fields for several miles around.
This habit had come down from feudal times, for
then the farmers had to abide together for protection.
And even now the inhabitants of Clair
had the habit of likewise dwelling with their draft
animals and cattle!
</p>
<p>
The narrow courts between the houses and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
stables were piled high with farm fertilizer, and
the flies were a pest. The hospital authorities
could not get the citizens to clean up the town.
What had been the custom for centuries must
always be custom, they thought.
</p>
<p>
The grumbling of the big guns on the battlefront
was almost continuous, day and night. It
got so that Ruth forgot the sound. At night,
from the narrow window of her cell, she could
see the white glare over the trenches far away.
By day black specks swinging to and fro in the
air marked the observation balloons. Occasionally
a darting airplane attracted her to the window
of her workroom.
</p>
<p>
Clair was kept dark at night. Scarcely the
glimmer of a candle was allowed to shine forth
from any window or doorway. There was a motion
picture theater in the main street; but one
had to creep to it by guess, and perhaps blunder
in at the door of the grocer’s shop, or the wine
merchant’s, before finding the picture show.
</p>
<p>
By day and night the French aircraft and the
anti-aircraft guns were ready to fight off enemy
airplanes. During the first weeks of Ruth Fielding’s
sojourn in the town there were two warnings
of German air raids at night. A deliberate
attempt more than once had been made to bomb
the Red Cross hospital.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was frightened. The first alarm came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
after she was in bed. She dressed hurriedly and
ran down into the nearest ward. But there was
no bustle there. The ringing of the church bells
and the blowing of the alarm siren had not disturbed
the patients here, and she saw Miss
Simone, the night nurse, quietly going about her
duties as though there was no stir outside.
</p>
<p>
Ruth remembered Charlie Bragg’s statement
of the case: “If they get you they get you, and
that’s all there is to it!” And she was ashamed
to show fear in the presence of the nurse.
</p>
<p>
The French drove off the raider that time.
The second time the German dropped bombs in
the town, but nobody was hurt, and he did not
manage to drop the bombs near the hospital.
Ruth was glad that she felt less panic in this second
raid than before.
</p>
<p>
Thinking of Charlie Bragg must have brought
that young man to see her. He came to the hospital
on his rest day; and then later appeared
driving his ambulance and asked her to ride.
</p>
<p>
The red cross she wore gave authority for
Ruth’s presence in the ambulance, and nobody
questioned their object in driving through the
back roads and lanes beyond Clair.
</p>
<p>
The country here was not torn up by marmite
holes, or the chasms made by the Big Berthas.
Such a lovely, quiet country as it was! Were it
not for the steady grumbling of the guns Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
Fielding could scarcely have believed that there
was such a thing as war.
</p>
<p>
But it was not likely that Ruth would ride
much with Charlie Bragg for the mere pleasure
of it. The young fellow drove at top speed at
all times, whether the road was smooth or
rutted.
</p>
<p>
“Really, I can’t help it, Miss Ruth,” he declared.
“Got the habit. We fellows want always
to get as far as we can with our loads before
something breaks down, or a shell gets us.
</p>
<p>
“By the way, seen anything of the werwolf
again?”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy! No. Do you suppose we did really
see anything that night?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know. I know there was an attack
made upon this sector two nights after that, and
a raid on an artillery base that we were keeping
particularly secret from the Boches. Somebody
must have told them.”
</p>
<p>
“The Germans are always flying over and
photographing everything,” said Ruth doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Not that battery. Had it camouflaged and
only worked on it nights. The Boches put a barrage
right behind it and sent over troops who did
a lot of damage.
</p>
<p>
“Believe me! You don’t know to what
lengths these German spies and German-lovers
go. You don’t know who is true and who is false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
about you. And the most ingenious schemes they
have,” added Charlie.
</p>
<p>
“They have tried secret wireless right here—within
two miles. But the radio makes too much
noise and is sure to be spotted at last. In one
place telegraph wires were carried for several
miles through the bed of a stream and the spy on
this side walked about with the telegraph instrument
in his pocket. When he got a chance he
went to the hut near the river bank, where the
ends of the wire were insulated, and tapped out
his messages.
</p>
<p>
“And pigeons! Don’t say a word. They’re
flying all the time, and sometimes they are shot
and the quills found under their wings. I tell
you spies just swarm all along this front.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” Ruth said, ruminatingly, “it must have
been a dog we saw that night.”
</p>
<p>
“The werwolf?” asked Charlie, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
“That is nonsense. It is a dog trained to run
between the spy on this side and somebody behind
the German lines. Poor dog!”
</p>
<p>
“Wow!” ejaculated the young fellow with disgust.
“Isn’t that just like a girl? ‘Poor dog,’
indeed!”
</p>
<p>
“Why! you don’t suppose that a noble dog
would <em>want</em> to be a spy?” cried Ruth. “You can
scarcely imagine a dog choosing any tricky way
through life. It is only men who deliberately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
choose despicable means to despicable ends.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on! Hold on!” cried Charlie Bragg.
“Spies are necessary—as long as there is going
to be war, anyway. The French have got quite
as brave and successful spies beyond the German
lines as the Germans have over here; only not so
many.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—I suppose that’s so,” admitted Ruth,
sighing. “There must be these terrible things as
long as the greater terrible thing, war, exists.
Oh! There is the chateau gateway. Drive
slower, Mr. Bragg—do, please!”
</p>
<p>
They mounted a little rise in the road. Above
they had seen the walls and towers of the chateau,
and had seen them clearly for some time. But
now the boundary wall of the estate edged the
road, and an arched gateway, with high grilled
gates and a small door set into the wall beside
the wider opening, came into view.
</p>
<p>
A single thought had stung Ruth Fielding’s
mind, but she did not utter it. It was: Why had
none of the German aviators dropped bombs upon
the stone towers on the hill? Was it a fact that
the enemy deliberately ignored the existence of
the chateau—that somebody in that great pile of
masonry won its immunity from German bombs
by playing the traitor to France and her cause?
</p>
<p>
Charlie had really reduced the speed of the
car until it was now only crawling up the slope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
of the road. Something fluttered at the postern-gate—a
woman’s petticoat.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the old woman,” said Charlie,
“Take a good look at her.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean the countess?” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Whiskers! No!” chuckled the young fellow.
“She’s a servant—or something. Dresses like
one of these French peasants about here. And
yet she isn’t French!”
</p>
<p>
“You have seen her before, then,” murmured
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Twice. There! Look at her mustache, will
you? She looks like a grenadier.”
</p>
<p>
The woman at the gate was a tall, square-shouldered
woman, with a hard, lined and almost
masculine countenance. She stared with gloomy
look as the Red Cross ambulance rolled by.
Ruth caught Charlie’s arm convulsively.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what was that?” she again whispered,
looking back at the woman in the gateway.
</p>
<p>
“What was what?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“That—something white—behind her—inside
the gate! Why, Mr. Bragg! was it a dog?”
</p>
<p>
“The werwolf,” chuckled the young chauffeur.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—SHOCKING NEWS</h2>
<p>
From both Helen and Jennie letters reached
the girl of the Red Mill quite frequently. Ruth
saw that always her correspondence was opened
and read by the censor; but that was the fate of
all letters that came to Clair.
</p>
<p>
“We innocents,” said the matron of the hospital,
“are thus afflicted because of the plague of
spies—a veritable Egyptian plague!—that infests
this part of my country. Do not be troubled,
Mam’zelle Americaine. You are not singled
out as though your friendliness to France
was questioned.
</p>
<p>
“And yet there may be those working in the
guise of the Red Cross who betray their trust,”
the woman added. “I hear of such.”
</p>
<p>
“Who are they? Where?” Ruth asked
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“It is said that at Lyse many of the supplies
sent to the Red Cross from your great and charitable
country, Mam’zelle, have been diverted to
private dealers and sold to the citizens. Oh, our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
French people—some of them—are hungry for
the very luxuries that the <em>blessés</em> should have. If
they have money they will spend it freely if good
things are to be bought.”
</p>
<p>
“At Lyse!” repeated Ruth. “Where I came
from?”
</p>
<p>
“Fear not that suspicion rests on you, <em>ma
chère amie</em>,” cooed the Frenchwoman. “Indeed,
no person in the active service of the Red Cross
at Lyse is suspected.”
</p>
<p>
“Nobody suspected in the supply department?”
asked Ruth doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no! The skirts of all are clear, I understand.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth said no more, but she was vastly worried
by what she had heard. What, really, had taken
place at Lyse? If a conspiracy had been discovered
for the robbing of the Red Cross Supply
Department, were not Mrs. Mantel and Legrand
and José engaged in it?
</p>
<p>
Yet it seemed that the woman in black was not
suspected. Ruth tried to learn more of the particulars,
but the matron of the Clair hospital did
not appear to know more than she had already
stated.
</p>
<p>
Ruth wrote to Clare Biggars immediately, asking
about the rumored trouble in their department
of the Red Cross at Lyse; but naturally
there would be delay before she could receive a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
reply, even if the censor allowed the information
to go through the mails.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Clair was shaken all through one
day and night by increased artillery fire on the
battle front. Never had Ruth Fielding heard the
guns roll so terribly. It was as though a continuous
thunderstorm shook the heavens and the
earth.
</p>
<p>
The Germans tried to drive back the reserves
behind the French trenches with the heaviest barrage
fire thus far experienced along this sector,
while they sent forward their shock troops to
overcome the thin French line in the dugouts.
</p>
<p>
Here and there the Germans gained a footing
in the front line of the French trenches; but always
they were driven out again, or captured.
</p>
<p>
The return barrage from the French guns at
last created such havoc among the German troops
that what remained of the latter were forced back
beyond their own front lines.
</p>
<p>
The casualties were frightful. News of the
raging battle came in with every ambulance to the
Clair Hospital. The field hospitals were overcrowded
and the wounded were being taken immediately
from the dressing stations behind the
trenches to the evacuation hospitals, like this of
Clair, before being operated upon.
</p>
<p>
This well-conducted institution, in which Ruth
had been busy for so many weeks, became in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
few hours a bustling, feverish place, with only
half enough nurses and fewer doctors than were
needed.
</p>
<p>
Ruth offered herself to the matron and was
given charge of one ward for all of one night,
while the surgeons and nurses battled in the operating
room and in the dangerous wards, with
the broken men who were brought in.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s ward was a quiet one. She had already
learned what to do in most small emergencies.
Besides, these patients were, most of them, well
on toward recovery, and they slept in spite of
what was going on downstairs.
</p>
<p>
On this night Clair was astir and alight. The
peril of an air raid was forgotten as the ambulances
rolled in from the north and east. The
soft roads became little better than quagmires
for it had rained during a part of the day.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally Ruth went to an open window
and looked down at the entrance to the hospital
yard, where the lantern light danced upon the
glistening cobblestones. Here the ambulances,
one after another, halted, while the stretcher-bearers
and guards said but little; all was in
monotone. But the steady sound of human voices
in dire pain could not be hushed.
</p>
<p>
Some of the wounded were delirious when they
were brought in. Perhaps they were better off.
</p>
<p>
Nor was Ruth Fielding’s sympathy altogether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
for the wounded soldiers. It was, as well, for
these young men who drove the ambulances—who
took their lives in their hands a score of
times during the twenty-four hours as they forced
their ambulances as near as possible to the front
to recover the broken men. She prayed for the
ambulance drivers.
</p>
<p>
Hour after hour dragged by until it was long
past midnight. There had been a lull in the procession
of ambulances for a time; but suddenly
Ruth saw one shoot out of the gloom of the upper
street and come rushing down to the gateway
of the hospital court.
</p>
<p>
This machine was stopped promptly and the
driver leaned forward, waving something in his
hand toward the sentinel.
</p>
<p>
“Hey!” cried a voice that Ruth recognized—none
other than that of Charlie Bragg. “Is Miss
Fielding still here?”
</p>
<p>
He asked this in atrocious French, but the
sentinel finally understood him.
</p>
<p>
“I will inquire, Monsieur.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the inquiring business,” declared
Charlie Bragg. “I’ve got to be on my way. I
<em>know</em> she’s here. Get this letter in to her, will
you? We’re taking ’em as far as Lyse now, old
man. Nice long roll for these poor fellows who
need major operations.”
</p>
<p>
He threw in his clutch again and the ambulance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
rocked away. Ruth left the window and ran
down to the entrance hall. The sentinel was just
coming up the steps with the note in his hand.
Before Ruth reached the man she saw that the
envelope was stained with blood!
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Is that for <em>me</em>?” the girl gasped, reaching
out for it.
</p>
<p>
“Quite so, Mam’zelle,” and the man handed
it to her with a polite gesture.
</p>
<p>
Ruth seized it, and, with only half-muttered
thanks, ran back to her ward. Her heart beat
so for a minute that she felt stifled. She could
not imagine what the note could be, or what it
was about.
</p>
<p>
Yet she had that intuitive feeling of disaster
that portends great and overwhelming events.
Her thought was of Tom—Tom Cameron! Who
else would send her a letter from the direction of
the battle line?
</p>
<p>
She sank into her chair by the shaded lamp
behind the nurse’s screen. For a time she could
not even look at the letter again, with its stain of
blood so plain upon it!
</p>
<p>
Then she brought it into line with her vision
and with the lamplight streaming upon it. The
bloody finger marks half effaced something that
was written upon the face of the envelope in a
handwriting strange to Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“This was found in tunic pocket of an American—badly
wounded—evacuated to L——. His
identification tag lost, as his arm was torn off at
elbow, and no tag around his neck.”
</p>
<p>
This brief statement was unsigned. Some
kindly Red Cross worker, perhaps, had written
it. Charlie Bragg must have known that the letter
was addressed to Ruth and offered to bring
it to her at Clair, the American on whom the
letter was found having been unconscious.
</p>
<p>
The flap on the envelope had not been sealed.
With trembling fingers the girl drew the paper
forth. Yes! It was in Tom Cameron’s handwriting,
and it began: “Dear Ruth Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
In his usual jovial style the letter proceeded.
It had evidently been written just before Tom
had been called to active duty in the trenches.
</p>
<p>
There were no American troops in the battle
line, as yet, Ruth well knew. But their officers,
in small squads, were being sent forward to learn
what it meant to be in the trenches under fire.
</p>
<p>
And Tom had been caught in this sudden
attack! Evacuated to Lyse! The field hospitals,
as well as this one at Clair, were overcrowded.
It was a long way to take wounded
men to Lyse to be operated upon.
</p>
<p>
“Operated upon!” The thought made Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
shudder. She turned sick and dizzy. Tom
Cameron crippled and unconscious! An arm torn
off! A cripple for the rest of his life!
</p>
<p>
She looked at the bloody fingerprints on the
envelope. Tom’s blood, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
He was being taken to Lyse, where nobody
would know him and he would know nobody!
Oh, why had it not been his fate to be brought
to this hospital at Clair where Ruth was stationed?
</p>
<p>
There was a faint call from one of the patients.
It occurred twice before the girl aroused to its
significance.
</p>
<p>
She must put aside her personal fears and
troubles. She was here to attend to the ward
while the regular night nurse was engaged elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Because Tom Cameron was wounded—perhaps
dying—she could not neglect her duty here.
She went quietly and brought a drink of cool
water to the feverish and restless <em>blessé</em> who had
called.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—AT THE WAYSIDE CROSS</h2>
<p>
The early hours of that morning were the most
tedious that Ruth Fielding ever had experienced.
She was tied here to the convalescent ward of
the Clair Hospital, while her every thought was
bent upon that rocking ambulance that might be
taking the broken body of Tom Cameron to the
great base hospital at Lyse.
</p>
<p>
Was it possible that Tom was in Charlie
Bragg’s car? What might not happen to the ambulance
on the dark and rough road over which
Ruth had once ridden with the young American
chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
While she was looking out of the window at
the ambulance as it halted at the gateway of the
hospital court, was poor Tom, unconscious and
wounded, in Charlie’s car? Oh! had she but suspected
it! Would she not have run down and
insisted that Tom be brought in here where she
might care for him?
</p>
<p>
Her heart was wrung by this possibility. She
felt condemned that she had not suspected Tom’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
presence at the time! Had not felt his nearness
to her!
</p>
<p>
Helen was far away in Paris. Already Mr.
Cameron was on the high seas. There was nobody
here so close to Tom as Ruth herself. Nor
could anybody else do more for him than Ruth, if
only she could find him!
</p>
<p>
The battle clouds and storm clouds both broke
in the east with the coming of the clammy dawn.
She saw the promise of a fair day just before sunrise;
then the usual morning fog shut down,
shrouding all the earth about the town. It would
be noon before the sun could suck up this
moisture.
</p>
<p>
Two hours earlier than expected the day nurse
came to relieve her. Ruth was thankful to be
allowed to go. Having spent the night here she
would not be expected to serve in her own department
that day. Yet she wished to see the matron
and put to her a request.
</p>
<p>
It was much quieter downstairs when she descended.
A nodding nurse in the hall told her
that every bed and every cot in the hospital was
filled. Some of the convalescents would be removed
as soon as possible so as to make room
for newly wounded poilus.
</p>
<p>
“But where is the matron?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, the good mother has gone to her bed—quite
fagged out. Twenty-four hours on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
feet—and she is no longer young. If I can do anything
for the Americaine mademoiselle——?”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth told her no. She would write a note
for <em>Madame la Directrice</em>, to be given to her
when she awoke. For the girl of the Red Mill
was determined to follow a plan of her own.
</p>
<p>
By rights she should be free until the next morning.
There were twenty-four hours before her
during which she need not report for service.
Had she not learned of Tom’s trouble she doubtless
would have taken a short nap and then appeared
to help in any department where she might
be of use.
</p>
<p>
But, to Ruth’s mind, Tom’s need was greater
than anything else just then. In her walks about
Clair she had become acquainted with a French
girl who drove a motor-car—Henriette Dupay.
Her father was one of the larger farmers, and
the family lived in a beautiful old house some
distance out of town. Ruth made a brief toilet, a
briefer breakfast, and ran out of the hospital,
taking the lane that led to the Dupay farm.
</p>
<p>
The fog was so thick close to the ground that
she could not see people in the road until she was
almost upon them. But, then, it was so early that
not many even of the early-rising farmers were
astir.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the night having been so racked
with the sounds of the guns,—now dying out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
thank heaven!-and the noise of the ambulances
coming in from the front and returning thereto,
that most of the inhabitants of Clair were exhausted
and slept late.
</p>
<p>
The American girl, well wrapped in a cloak
and with an automobile veil wound about her hat
and pulled down to her ears, walked on hurriedly,
stopping now and then at a crossroad to
make sure she was on the right track.
</p>
<p>
If Henriette Dupay could get her father’s car,
and would drive Ruth to Lyse, the latter would
be able to assure herself about Tom one way or
another. She felt that she must know just how
badly the young fellow was wounded!
</p>
<p>
To think! An arm torn off at the elbow—if
it was really Tom who had been picked up with
the note Ruth had received in his pocket. It was
dreadful to think of.
</p>
<p>
At one point in her swift walk Ruth found herself
sobbing hysterically. Yet she was not
a girl who broke down easily. Usually she was
selfcontrolled. Helen accused her sometimes of
being even phlegmatic.
</p>
<p>
She took a new grip upon herself. Her nerves
must not get the best of her! It might not be
Tom Cameron at all who was wounded. There
were other American officers mixed in with the
French troops on this sector of the battle front—surely!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
Yet, who else but Tom would have carried that
letter written to “Dear Ruth Fielding”? The
more the girl of the Red Mill thought of it the
more confident she was that there could have been
no mistake made. Tom had fallen wounded in
the trenches and was now in the big hospital at
Lyse, where she had worked for some weeks in
the ranks of the Red Cross recruits.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the girl was halted by a voice in the
fog. A shrill exclamation in a foreign tone—not
French—sounded just ahead. It was a man’s
voice, and a woman’s answered. The two seemed
to be arguing; but to hear people talking in anything
but French or English in this part of France
was enough to astonish anybody.
</p>
<p>
“That is not German. It is a Latin tongue,”
thought the girl, wonderingly. “Italian or Spanish,
perhaps. Who can it be?”
</p>
<p>
She started forward again, yet walked softly,
for the moss and short grass beside the road made
her footfalls indistinguishable a few yards away.
There loomed up ahead of her a wayside cross—one
of those weather-worn and ancient monuments
so often seen in that country.
</p>
<p>
In walking with Henriette Dupay, Ruth had
seen the French girl kneel a moment at this junction
of the two lanes, and whisper a prayer. Indeed,
the American girl had followed her example,
for she believed that God hears the reverent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
prayer wherever it is made. And Ruth had felt
of late that she had much to pray for.
</p>
<p>
The voices of the two wrangling people suggested
no worship, however. Nor were they
kneeling at the wayside shrine. She saw them,
at last, standing in the middle of the cross lane.
One, she knew, had come down from the
chateau.
</p>
<p>
Ruth saw that the woman was the heavy-faced
creature whom she had once seen at the gateway
of the chateau when riding past with Charlie
Bragg. This strange-looking old woman Charlie
had said was a servant of the countess up at the
chateau and that she was not a Frenchwoman.
Indeed, the countess herself was not really
French, but was Alsatian, and “the wrong kind,”
to use the chauffeur’s expression.
</p>
<p>
The American girl caught a glimpse of the
woman’s face and then hid her own with her veil.
But the man’s countenance she did not behold until
she had passed the shrine and had looked
back.
</p>
<p>
He had wheeled to look after Ruth. He was a
small man and suddenly she saw, as he stepped
out to trace her departure more clearly, that he
was lame. He wore a heavy shoe on one foot
with a thick and clumsy sole-such as the supposed
Italian chef had worn coming over from
America on the Red Cross ship.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
Was it the man, José, suspected with Legrand
and Mrs. Rose Mantel—all members of a band
of conspirators pledged to rob the Red Cross?
Ruth dared not halt for another glance at him.
She pulled the veil further over her face and
scuttled on up the lane toward the Dupay farmhouse.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—MANY THINGS HAPPEN</h2>
<p>
Ruth reached the farmhouse just as the family
was sitting down to breakfast. The house and
outbuildings of the Dupays were all connected, as
is the way in this part of France. No shell had
fallen near the buildings, which was very fortunate,
indeed.
</p>
<p>
Henriette’s father was a one-armed man. He
had lost his left arm at the Marne, and had been
honorably discharged, to go back to farming, in
order to try to raise food for the army and for
the suffering people of France. His two sons and
his brothers were still away at the wars, so every
child big enough to help, and the women of the
family as well, aided in the farm work.
</p>
<p>
No petrol could be used to drive cars for
pleasure; but Henriette sometimes had to go for
supplies, or to carry things to market, or do other
errands connected with the farm work. Ruth
hoped that the French girl would be allowed to
help her.
</p>
<p>
The hospitable Dupays insisted upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
American girl’s sitting down to table with them.
She was given a seat on the bench between Henriette
and Jean, a lad of four, who looked shyly
up at the visitor from under heavy brown lashes,
and only played with his food.
</p>
<p>
It was not the usual French breakfast to which
Ruth Fielding had become accustomed—coffee
and bread, with possibly a little compote, or an
egg. There was meat on the table—a heavy
meal, for it was to be followed by long hours of
heavy labor.
</p>
<p>
“What brings you out so early after this awful
night?” Henriette whispered to her visitor.
</p>
<p>
Ruth told her. She could eat but little, she was
so anxious about Tom Cameron. She made it
plain to the interested French girl just why she
so desired to follow on to Lyse and learn if it
really was Tom who had been wounded, as the
message on the blood-stained envelope said.
</p>
<p>
“I might start along the road and trust to some
ambulance overtaking me,” Ruth explained.
“But often there is a wounded man who can sit up
riding on the seat with the driver—sometimes
two. I could not take the place of such an unfortunate.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be much too far for you to walk,
Mademoiselle,” said the mother, overhearing.
“We can surely help you.”
</p>
<p>
She spoke to her husband—a huge man, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
whom Ruth stood rather in awe, he was so stern-looking
and taciturn. But Henriette said he had
been a “laughing man” before his experience in
the war. War had changed many people, this
French girl said, nodding her head wisely.
</p>
<p>
“The venerable Countess Marchand,” pointing
to the chateau on the hill, “had been neighborly
and kind until the war came. Now she shut herself
away from all the neighbors, and if a body
went to the chateau it was only to be confronted
by old Bessie, who was the countess’ housekeeper,
and her only personal servant now.”
</p>
<p>
“Old Bessie,” Ruth judged, must be the hard-featured
woman she had seen at the chateau gate
and, on this particular morning, talking to the
lame man at the wayside cross.
</p>
<p>
The American girl waited now in some trepidation
for Dupay to speak. He seemed to consider
the question of Ruth’s getting to Lyse quite
seriously for some time; then he said quietly that
he saw no objection to Henriette taking the sacks
of grain to M. Naubeck in the touring car body
instead of the truck, and going to-day to Lyse on
that errand instead of the next week.
</p>
<p>
It was settled so easily. Henriette ran away
to dress, while a younger brother slipped out to
see that the car was in order for the two girls.
Ruth knew she could not offer the Dupays any
remuneration for the trouble they took for her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
but she was so thankful to them that she was
almost in tears when she and Henriette started
for Lyse half an hour later.
</p>
<p>
“The main road is so cut up and rutted by the
big lorries and ambulances that we would better
go another way,” Henriette said, as she steered
out of the farm lane into the wider road.
</p>
<p>
They turned away from Lyse, it seemed to
Ruth; but, after circling around the hill on which
the chateau stood, they entered a more traveled
way, but one not so deeply rutted.
</p>
<p>
A mile beyond this point, and just as the motor-car
came down a gentle slope to a small stream,
crossed by a rustic bridge, the two girls spied
another automobile, likewise headed toward
Lyse. It was stalled, both wheels on the one side
being deep in a muddy rut.
</p>
<p>
There were two men with the car—a small man
and a much taller individual, who was dressed in
the uniform of a French officer—a captain, as
Ruth saw when they came nearer.
</p>
<p>
The little man stepped into the woods, perhaps
for a sapling, with which to pry up the car, before
the girls reached the bottom of the hill. At
least, they only saw his back. But when Ruth
gained a clear view of the officer’s face she was
quite shocked.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” Henriette asked her,
driving carefully past the stalled car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth remained silent until they were across the
bridge and the French girl had asked her question
a second time, saying:
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Mademoiselle Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know that man?” Ruth returned,
proving herself a true Yankee by answering one
question with another.
</p>
<p>
“The captain? No. I do not know him.
There are many captains,” and Henriette
laughed.
</p>
<p>
“He—he looks like somebody I know,” Ruth
said hesitatingly. She did not wish to explain her
sudden shocked feeling on seeing the man’s face.
He looked like the shaven Legrand who, on the
ship coming over and in Lyse, had called himself
“Professor Perry.”
</p>
<p>
If this was the crook, who, Ruth believed, had
set fire to the business office of the Robinsburg
Red Cross headquarters, he had evidently not
been arrested in connection with the supply department
scandal, of which the matron of the
hospital had told her. At least, he was now free.
And the little fellow with him! Had not Ruth,
less than two hours before, seen José talking with
the woman from the chateau at the wayside shrine
near Clair?
</p>
<p>
The mysteries of these two men and their disguises
troubled Ruth Fielding vastly. It seemed
that the prefect of police at Lyse had not apprehended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
them. Nor was Mrs. Mantel yet in the
toils.
</p>
<p>
This was a longer way to Lyse by a number
of miles than the main road; nevertheless, it was
probable that the girls gained time by following
the more roundabout route.
</p>
<p>
It was not yet noon when Henriette stopped
at a side entrance to the hospital where Ruth
had served her first few weeks for the Red Cross
in France. The girl of the Red Mill sprang out,
and, asking her friend to wait for her, ran into
the building.
</p>
<p>
The guard remembered her, and nobody
stopped her on the way to the reception office,
where a record was kept of all the patients in the
great building. The girl at the desk was a
stranger to Ruth, but she answered the visitor’s
questions as best she could.
</p>
<p>
She looked over the records of the wounded
accepted from the battle front or from evacuation
hospitals during the past forty-eight hours.
There was no such name as Cameron on the list;
and, as far as the clerk knew, no American at all
among the number.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there <em>must</em> be!” gasped Ruth, wringing
her hands. “Surely there is a mistake. There is
no other hospital here for him to be brought to,
and I am sure this person was brought to Lyse.
They say his arm is torn off at the elbow.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
A nurse passing through the office stopped and
inquired in French of whom Ruth was speaking.
The girl of the Red Mill explained.
</p>
<p>
“I believe we have the <em>blessé</em> in my ward,”
this nurse said kindly. “Will you come and see,
Mademoiselle? He has been quite out of his
head, and perhaps he is an American, for he has
not spoken French. We thought him English.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let me see him!” cried Ruth, and hastened
with her into one of the wards where she knew
the most serious cases were cared for.
</p>
<p>
Her fears almost overcame the girl. Her
interest in Tom Cameron was deep and abiding.
For years they had been friends, and now, of
late, a stronger feeling than friendship had developed
in her heart for Tom.
</p>
<p>
His courage, his cheerfulness, the real, solid
worth of the young fellow, could not fail to endear
him to one who knew him as well as did
Ruth Fielding. If he had been shot down, mangled,
injured, perhaps, to the very death!
</p>
<p>
How would Helen and their father feel if Tom
was seriously wounded? If Ruth found him here
in the hospital, should she immediately communicate
with his twin sister in Paris, and with his
father, who had doubtless reached the States by
this time?
</p>
<p>
Her mind thus in a turmoil, she followed the
nurse into the ward and down the aisle between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
the rows of cots. She had helped comfort the
wounded in this very ward when she worked in
this hospital; but she looked now for no familiar
face, save one. She looked ahead for the white,
strained countenance of Tom Cameron against the
coarse pillow-slip.
</p>
<p>
The nurse stopped beside a cot. Oh, the relief!
There was no screen around it! The occupant
was turned with his face away from the aisle.
The stump of the uplifted arm on his left side,
bandaged and padded, was uppermost.
</p>
<p>
“Tom!” breathed the girl of the Red Mill,
holding back just a little and with a hand upon
her breast.
</p>
<p>
It was a head of black hair upon the pillow.
It might easily have been Tom Cameron. And
in a moment Ruth was sure that he was an
American from the very contour of his visage—but
it was <em>not</em> Tom!
</p>
<p>
“Oh! It’s not! It’s not!” she kept saying
over and over to herself. And then she suddenly
found herself sitting in a chair at the end
of the ward and the nurse was saying to her:
</p>
<p>
“Are you about to faint, Mademoiselle? It is
the friend you look for?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no! I sha’n’t faint,” Ruth declared, getting
a grip upon her nerves again. “It is not my
friend. Oh! I cannot tell you how relieved I
am.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yes! I know,” sighed the Frenchwoman.
“I have a father and a brother in our
army and after every battle I fear until I hear
from them. I am glad for your sake it is another
than your friend. And yet—<em>he</em> will have friends
who suffer, too—is it not?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—AGAIN THE WERWOLF</h2>
<p>
Ruth Fielding felt as though she needed a
cup of tea more than she ever had before in her
life. And Clare Biggars had her own tea service
in her room at the pension. Ruth had inquired
for Clare and learned that this was a free hour
for the Kansas girl. So Ruth and Henriette
Dupay drove to the boarding-house; for to get a
good cup of tea in one of the restaurants or cafés
was impossible.
</p>
<p>
Her relief at learning the wounded American
in the hospital was not Tom Cameron was quite
overwhelming at first. Ruth had come out to the
car so white of face that the French girl was
frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Mam’zelle Fielding! It is that you haf
los’ your friend?” cried the girl in the stammering
English she tried so hard to make perfect.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that,” sighed Ruth. “But, at
least, if he is wounded, he was not brought here
to this hospital.”
</p>
<p>
She could not understand how that letter had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
been found in the pocket of the young man she
had seen in the hospital ward. Tom Cameron
certainly had written that letter. Ruth would not
be free from worry until she had heard again
from Tom, or of him.
</p>
<p>
The pension was not far away, and Ruth made
her friend lock the car and come in with her, for
Clare was a hospitable soul and it was lunch time.
To her surprise Ruth found Clare in tears.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter, my dear girl?” cried
Ruth, as Clare fled sobbing to her arms the moment
she saw the girl of the Red Mill. “What
can have happened to you?”
</p>
<p>
“Everything!” exploded the Kansas girl. “You
can’t imagine! I’ve all but been arrested, and
the Head called me down dreadfully, and
Madame——”
</p>
<p>
“Madame Mantel?” Ruth asked sharply. “Is
she the cause of your troubles? I should have
warned you——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the poor dear!” groaned Clare. “She
feels as bad about it as I do. Why, they took her
to the police station, too!”
</p>
<p>
“You seem to have all been having a fine time,”
Ruth said, rather tartly. “Tell me all about it.
But ask us to sit down, and <em>do</em> give us a cup of
tea. This is Henriette Dupay, Clare, and a very
nice girl she is. Try to be cordial—hold up the
reputation of America, my dear.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
“How-do?” gulped Clare, giving the French
girl her hand. “I <em>am</em> glad Ruth brought you.
But it was only yesterday——”
</p>
<p>
“What was only yesterday?” asked Ruth, as
the hostess began to set out the tea things.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth! Haven’t you heard something
about the awful thing that happened here? That
Professor Perry——”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! What about him?” asked Ruth. “You
know what I wrote you—that I had heard there
was trouble in the Supply Department? You
haven’t answered my letter.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I was too worried. And finally—only
yesterday, as I said—I was ordered to appear
before the prefect of police.”
</p>
<p>
“A nice old gentleman with a white mustache.”
</p>
<p>
“A horrid old man who said the <em>meanest</em> things
to dear Madame Mantel!” cried Clare hotly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth saw that the Western girl was still
enamored of the woman in black, so she was
careful what she said in comment upon Clare’s
story.
</p>
<p>
All Ruth had to do was to keep still and Clare
told it all. Perhaps Henriette did not understand
very clearly what the trouble was, but she looked
sympathetic, too, and that encouraged Clare.
</p>
<p>
It seemed that Mrs. Mantel had made a companion
of Clare outside of the hospital, and Ruth
could very well understand why. Clare’s father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
was a member of Congress and a wealthy man.
It was to be presumed that Clare seemed to the
woman in black well worth cultivating.
</p>
<p>
The Kansas girl had gone with the woman to
the café of the Chou-rouge more than once. Each
time the so-called Professor Perry and the Italian
commissioner, whose name Clare had forgotten—“But
that’s of no consequence,” thought Ruth,
“for he has so many names!”—had been very
friendly with the Red Cross workers.
</p>
<p>
Then suddenly the professor and the Italian
had disappeared. The head of the Lyse hospital
had begun to make inquiries into the working of
the Supply Department. There had been billed
to Lyse great stores of goods that were not accounted
for.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Madame Mantel was heartbroken,”
Clare said. “She wished to resign at once. Oh,
it’s been terrible!”
</p>
<p>
“Resign under fire?” suggested Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—you understand—she felt so bad that her
department should be under suspicion. Of course,
it was not her fault.”
</p>
<p>
“Did the head say <em>that</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he didn’t have to!” cried Clare. “I
hope <em>you</em> are not suspicious of Madame Mantel,
Ruth Fielding?”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t told me enough to cause me to
suspect anybody yet—save yourself,” laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
Ruth. “I suspect that you are telling the story
very badly, my dear.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I suppose that is so,” admitted Clare,
and thereafter she tried to speak more connectedly
about the trouble which had finally engrossed
all her thought.
</p>
<p>
The French police had unearthed, it was said,
a wide conspiracy for the diversion of Red Cross
supplies from America to certain private hands.
These goods had been signed for in Mrs. Mantel’s
office; she did not know by whom, but the
writing on the receipts was not in her hand.
That was proved. And, of course, the goods had
never been delivered to the hospital at Lyse.
</p>
<p>
The receipts must have been forged. The
only point made against Mrs. Mantel, it seemed,
was that she had not reported that these goods,
long expected at Lyse, were not received. Her
delay in making inquiry for the supplies gave the
thieves opportunity for disposing of the goods
and getting away with the money paid for them
by dishonest French dealers.
</p>
<p>
The men who had disposed of the supplies and
had pocketed the money (or so it was believed)
were the man who called himself Professor Perry
and the Italian commissioner.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you think?” Clare went on to
say. “That professor is no college man at all.
He is a well-known French crook, they say, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
usually travels under the name of Legrand.
</p>
<p>
“They say he had been in America until it got
too hot for him there, and he crossed on the same
boat with us—you remember, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I remember,” groaned the girl of the
Red Mill. “The Italian, too?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know for sure about him. They say
he isn’t an Italian, but a Mexican, anyway. And
he has a police record in both hemispheres.
</p>
<p>
“Consider! Madame Mantel and I were seen
hobnobbing with them! I know she feels just
as I do. I hate to show myself on the street!”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t feel that way,” Ruth replied
soothingly. “You could not help it.”
</p>
<p>
“But the police—ordering me before that
nasty old prefect!” exclaimed the angry girl.
“And he said such things to me! Think! He
had cabled the chief of police in my town to ask
who I was and if I had a police record. What
do you suppose my father will say?”
</p>
<p>
“I guarantee that he will laugh at you,” Ruth
declared. “Don’t take it so much to heart. Remember
we are in a strange country, and that
that country is at war.”
</p>
<p>
“I never shall like the French system of government,
just the same!” declared Clare, with
emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“And—and what about Mrs. Mantel?” Ruth
asked doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am going over to see her now,” Clare said,
wiping her eyes. “I am so sorry for her. I believe
that horrid prefect thinks she is mixed up in
the plot that has cost the Red Cross so much.
They say nearly ten thousand dollars worth of
goods was stolen, and those two horrid men—Professor
Perry and the other—have got away
and the French police cannot find them.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was secretly much disturbed by Clare’s
story. She believed that she knew something
about the pair of crooks who were accused—Rose
Mantel’s two friends—that might lead to their
capture. She was sure Henriette Dupay and she
had passed them with their stalled automobile on
the road to Lyse that morning.
</p>
<p>
In addition, she believed the two crooks were
connected with those people at the Chateau
Marchand, who were supposed to be pro-German.
Now she knew what language she had heard
spoken by José and the hard-featured Bessie of
the chateau, there by the wayside cross. It was
Spanish. The woman might easily be a Mexican
as well as José.
</p>
<p>
Should she go to the prefect of police and tell
him of these things? It seemed to Ruth Fielding
that she was much entangled in a conspiracy of
wide significance. The crooks who had robbed
the Red Cross seemed lined up with the spies of
the Chateau Marchand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
And there was the strange animal—dog, or
what-not!—that was connected with the chateau.
The werwolf! Whether she believed in such
traditional tales or not, the American girl was
impressed with the fact that there was much that
was suspicious in the whole affair.
</p>
<p>
Yet she naturally shrank from getting her own
fingers caught in the cogs of this mystery that the
French police were doubtless quite able to handle
in their own way, and all in good time. It was
evident that even Mrs. Mantel was not to be allowed
to escape the police net. She had not been
arrested yet; but she doubtless was watched so
closely now that she could neither get away, nor
aid in doing further harm.
</p>
<p>
As for Clare Biggars, she was perfectly innocent
of all wrong-doing or intent. And she was
quite old enough to take care of herself. Besides,
her father would doubtless be warned that his
daughter was under suspicion of the French police
and he would communicate with the United States
Ambassador at Paris. She would be quite safe
and suffer no real trouble.
</p>
<p>
So Ruth decided to return to Clair without going
to the police, and, after lunch, having delivered
the bags of grain which had filled the tonneau
of the car, she and Henriette Dupay drove
out of town again.
</p>
<p>
They were delayed for some time by tire trouble, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
the French girl proved herself as good
a mechanic as was necessary in repairing the
tube. But night was falling before they were halfway
home.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s thoughts were divided between the conspiracy,
in which Mrs. Mantel was engaged, and
her worry regarding Tom Cameron. She had
filed a telegraph message at the Lyse Hospital
to be sent to Tom’s cantonment, where he was
training, and hoped that the censor would allow
it to go through. For she knew she could not be
satisfied that Tom had not been wounded until
she heard from him.
</p>
<p>
The American girl’s nerves had been shot
through by the affair of the early morning, when
the note from Tom had been brought to her.
What had followed since that hour had not served
to help her regain her self-control.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, as Henriette drove the car on
through the twilight, following the road by which
they had gone to Lyse, there was reason for Ruth
suddenly exclaiming aloud, when she saw something
in the track ahead:
</p>
<p>
“Henriette! Look! What can that be? Do
you see it?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you see, Mademoiselle Ruth?”
asked the French girl, reducing the speed of the
car in apprehension.
</p>
<p>
“There! That white——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“<em>Nom de Dieu!</em>” shrieked Henriette, getting
sight of the object in question.
</p>
<p>
The girl paled visibly and shrank back into her
seat. Ruth cried out, fearing the steering wheel
would get away from Henriette.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Did you see?” gasped the latter.
</p>
<p>
The white object had suddenly disappeared.
It seemed to Ruth as though it had actually melted
into thin air.
</p>
<p>
“That was the werwolf!” continued the French
girl, and crossed herself. “Oh, my dear Mademoiselle,
something is sure now to happen—something
very bad!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—THE COUNTESS AND HER DOG</h2>
<p>
RUTH FIELDING had almost instantly identified
the swiftly moving object in the road as the same
that she had seen weeks before while riding with
Charlie Bragg toward Clair. And yet she could
not admit as true the assertion made both by the
ambulance driver and the excited French girl.
</p>
<p>
To recognize the quickly disappearing creature
as a werwolf—the beast-form of a human being,
sold irrevocably to the Powers of Darkness—was
quite too much for a sane American girl like Ruth
Fielding!
</p>
<p>
“Why, Henriette!” she cried, “that is nothing
but a dog.”
</p>
<p>
“A wolf, Mademoiselle. A werwolf, as I
have told you. A very wicked thing.”
</p>
<p>
“There isn’t such a thing,” declared Ruth
bluntly. “That was a dog—a white or a gray
one. And of large size. I have seen it once before—perhaps
twice,” Ruth added, remembering
the glimpse she had caught of such a creature
with Bessie at the chateau gate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it is such bad fortune to see it!” sighed
Henriette.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be so childish,” Ruth adjured,
brusquely. “Nothing about that dog can hurt
you. But I have an idea the poor creature may
be doing the French cause harm.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mademoiselle! You have heard the vile
talk about the dear countess!” cried Henriette.
“It is not so. She is a brave and lovely lady.
She gives her all for France. She would be filled
with horror if she knew anybody connected her
with the spies of <em>les Boches</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought it was generally believed that she
was an Alsatian <em>of the wrong kind</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a wicked calumny,” Henriette declared
earnestly. “But I have heard the tale of the
werwolf ever since I was a child—long before
this dreadful war began.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“It was often seen racing through the country
by night,” the girl declared earnestly. “They
say it comes from the chateau, and goes back to
it. But that the lovely countess is a wicked one,
and changes herself into a devouring wolf—ah,
no, no, Mademoiselle! It is impossible!
</p>
<p>
“The werwolf comes and goes across the
battle front, it is said. Indeed, it used to cross
the old frontier into Germany in pre-war times.
Why may not some wicked German woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
change herself into a wolf and course the woods
and fields at night? Why lay such a thing to the
good Countess Marchand?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth saw that the girl was very much in earnest,
and she cast no further doubt upon the occupant
of the chateau, the towers of which had been
in sight in the twilight for some few minutes.
Henriette was now driving slowly and had not
recovered from her fright. They came to a road
which turned up the hill.
</p>
<p>
“Where does that track lead?” Ruth asked
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Past the gates of the chateau, Mademoiselle.”
</p>
<p>
“You say you will take me to the hospital at
Clair before going home,” Ruth urged. “Can
we not take this turn?”
</p>
<p>
“But surely,” agreed Henriette, and steered
the car into the narrow and well-kept lane.
</p>
<p>
Ruth made no explanation for her request.
But she felt sure that the object which had startled
them both, dog or whatever it was, had dived
into this lane to disappear so quickly. The “werwolf”
was going toward the chateau on this evening
instead of away from it.
</p>
<p>
There was close connection between the two
criminals, who had come from America on the
Red Cross steamship, Legrand and José, with
whatever was going on between the Chateau
Marchand and the Germans. Werwolf, or despatch dog,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
Ruth was confident that the creature
that ran by night across the shell-racked fields was
trained to spy work.
</p>
<p>
Who was guilty at the chateau? That seemed
to be an open question.
</p>
<p>
Henriette’s declaration that it was not the
Countess Marchand, strengthened the suspicion
already rife in Ruth’s mind that the old servant,
Bessie, was the German-lover.
</p>
<p>
The latter was known to José, one of the crooks
from America. She might easily be of the same
nationality as José—Mexican. And the Mexicans
largely are pro-German.
</p>
<p>
José and Legrand were already under suspicion
of a huge swindle in Red Cross stores. It would
seem that if these men would steal, it was fair to
presume they would betray the French Government
for money.
</p>
<p>
It was a mixed-up and doubtful situation at
best. Ruth Fielding intuitively felt that she had
hold of the ends of certain threads of evidence
that must, in time, lead to the unraveling of the
whole scheme of deceit and intrigue.
</p>
<p>
It was still light enough on the upland for the
girls to see some distance along the road ahead.
Henriette drove the car slowly as they approached
the wide gateway of the chateau.
</p>
<p>
Ruth distinguished the flutter of something
white by the gate and wondered if it was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
“werwolf” or the old serving woman. But when
she called Henriette’s attention to the moving
object the French girl cried, under her breath:
</p>
<p>
“Oh! It is the countess! Look you, Mademoiselle
Ruth, perhaps she will speak to us.”
</p>
<p>
“But there’s something with her. It <em>is</em> a dog,”
the American girl declared.
</p>
<p>
“Why that is only Bubu, the old hound. He is
always with the countess when she walks out. He
is a greyhound—see you? It is foolish, Mademoiselle,
to connect Bubu with the werwolf,” and
she shrugged her plump shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Ruth paid more attention to the dog at first
than she did to the lady who held the loop of his
leash. He wore a dark blanket, which covered
most of his body, even to his ears. His legs were
long, of course, and Ruth discovered another thing
in a moment, while the car rolled nearer.
</p>
<p>
The thin legs of the slate-colored beast were
covered with mud. That mud was not yet dry.
The dog had been running at large within the
last few minutes, the girl was sure.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—RUTH DOES HER DUTY</h2>
<p>
The query that came sharply to Ruth Fielding’s
mind was: Without his blanket and off his
leash, what would Bubu, the greyhound, look like
in the gloaming? The next moment the tall old
lady walking by the observant dog’s side, raised
her hand and nodded to Henriette.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Madame!” gasped the French girl, and
brought the car to an instant stop.
</p>
<p>
“I thought it was my little Hetty,” the countess
said in French, and smiling. “Hast been to Lyse
for the good father?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Madame,” replied the girl.
</p>
<p>
“And what news do you bring?”
</p>
<p>
The voice of the old lady was very kind.
Ruth, watching her closely, thought that if the
Countess Marchand was a spy for Germany, and
was wicked at heart, she was a wonderfully good
actress.
</p>
<p>
She had a most graceful carriage. Her hair,
which was snow white, was dressed most becomingly.
Her cheeks were naturally pink; yet her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
throat and under her chin the skin was like old
ivory and much wrinkled. She was dressed
plainly, although the cape about her shoulders
was trimmed with expensive fur.
</p>
<p>
Henriette replied to her queries bashfully,
bobbing her head at every reply. She was much
impressed by the lady’s attention. Finally the
latter looked full at Ruth, and asked:
</p>
<p>
“Your friend is from the hospital, Hetty?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, Madame!” Henriette hastened to
say. “She is an <em>Americaine</em>. Of the Red Cross.”
</p>
<p>
“I could imagine her nativity,” said the countess,
bowing to Ruth, and with cordiality. “I
traveled much with the count—years ago. All
over America. I deem all Americans my
friends.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Madame,” replied Ruth gravely.
</p>
<p>
At the moment the stern-faced Bessie came
through the little postern gate. She approached
the countess and stood for a moment respectfully
waiting her mistress’ attention.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, here is the good Bessie,” said the countess,
and passed the serving woman the loop of
the dog’s leather leash. “Take him away,
Bessie. Naughty Bubu! Do you know, he should
be punished—and punished severely. He had
slipped his collar again. See his legs? You
must draw the collar up another hole, Bessie.”
</p>
<p>
The harsh voice of the old woman replied, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
Ruth could not understand what she said. The
dog was led away; but Ruth saw that Bessie
stared at her, Ruth, curiously—or was it threateningly?
</p>
<p>
The countess turned again to speak to the two
girls. “Old Bessie comes from America, Mademoiselle,”
she explained. “I brought her over
years ago. She has long served me.”
</p>
<p>
“She comes from Mexico, does she not?” Ruth
asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I see you have bright eyes—you are
observant,” said the countess. “Yes. Mexico
was Bessie’s birthplace, although she is not all
Spanish.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth thought to herself: “I could guarantee
that. She is part German. ‘Elizabeth’—yes, indeed!
And does this lady never suspect what her
serving woman may be?”
</p>
<p>
The countess dismissed them with another
kindly word and gesture. Henriette was very
much wrought up over the incident.
</p>
<p>
“She is a great lady,” she whispered to Ruth.
“Wait till I tell my father and mother how she
spoke to me. They will be delighted.”
</p>
<p>
“And this is a republic!” smiled Ruth. Even
mild toadyism did not much please this American
girl. “Still,” she thought, “we are inclined to
bow down and worship a less worthy aristocracy
at home—the aristocracy of wealth.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
Henriette ran her down to the town and to the
hospital gate. Ruth was more than tired—she
felt exhausted when she got out of the car. But
she saw the matron before retiring to her own
cell for a few hours’ sleep.
</p>
<p>
“We shall need you, Mademoiselle,” the
Frenchwoman said distractedly. “Oh! so many
poor men are here. They have been bringing
them in all day. There is a lull on the front, or
I do not know what we should do. The poor,
poor men!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had to rest for a while, however, although
she did not sleep. Her mind was too painfully
active.
</p>
<p>
Her thoughts drummed continually upon two
subjects, the mystery regarding Tom Cameron—his
letter to her found in another man’s pocket.
Secondly, the complications of the plot in which
the woman in black, the two crooks from America,
and the occupants of the chateau seemed all entangled.
</p>
<p>
She hoped hourly to hear from Tom; but no
word came. She wished, indeed, that she might
even see Charlie Bragg again; but nobody seemed
to have seen him about the hospital of late. The
ambulance corps was shifted around so frequently
that there was no knowing where he could be
found, save at his headquarters up near the front.
And Ruth Fielding felt that she was quite as near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
the front here at Clair as she ever wished to be!
</p>
<p>
She went on duty before midnight and remained
at work until after supper the next evening.
She had nothing to do with the severely
wounded, of course; but there was plenty to do
for those who had already been in the hospital
some time, and whom she knew.
</p>
<p>
Ruth could aid them in simple matters, could
read to them, write for them, quiet them if they
were nervous or suffering from shell-shock. She
tried to forget her personal anxieties in attending
to the poor fellows and aiding them to forget
their wounds, if for only a little while.
</p>
<p>
But she climbed to her cell at last, worn out as
she was by the long strain, with a determination
to communicate with the French police-head in
Lyse regarding the men who had robbed the Red
Cross supply department.
</p>
<p>
She wrote the letter with the deliberate intention
of laying all the mystery, as she saw it, before
the authorities. She would protect the
woman in black no longer. Nor did she ignore
the possibility of the Countess Marchand and her
old serving woman being in some way connected
with Legrand and José, the Mexican.
</p>
<p>
She lay bare the fact that the two men from
America had been in a plot to rob the Red Cross at
Robinsburg, and how they had accomplished their
ends with the connivance (as Ruth believed) of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
Rose Mantel. She spared none of the particulars
of this early incident.
</p>
<p>
She wrote that she had seen the man, José, in
his character of the lame Italian, both on the
steamship coming over, in Paris, and again here
at Clair talking with the Mexican servant of the
Countess Marchand. Legrand, too, she mentioned
as being in the neighborhood of Clair, now
dressed as a captain of infantry in the French
army.
</p>
<p>
She quite realized what she was doing in writing
all this. Legrand, for instance, risked death
as a spy in any case if he represented himself as
an officer. But Ruth felt that the matter was
serious. Something very bad was going on here,
she was positive.
</p>
<p>
The only thing she could not bring herself to
tell of was the suspicions she had regarding the
identity of the “werwolf,” as the superstitious
country people called the shadowy animal that
raced the fields and roads by night, going to and
coming from the battle front.
</p>
<p>
It seemed such a silly thing—to repeat such
gossip of the country side to the police authorities!
She could not bring herself to do it. If the
occupants of the chateau were suspected of being
disloyal, what Ruth had already written, connecting
José with Bessie, would be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
She wrote and despatched this letter at once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
She knew it would be unopened by the local
censor because of the address upon it. Communications
to the police were privileged.
</p>
<p>
Ruth wondered much what the outcome of this
step would be. She shrank from being drawn
into a police investigation; but the matter had
gone so far now and was so serious that she could
not dodge her duty.
</p>
<p>
That very next day word was sent in to Ruth
from the guard at the entrance whom she had
tipped for that purpose, that the American ambulance
driver, Monsieur Bragg, was at the door.
</p>
<p>
When Ruth hastened to the court the <em>brancardiers</em>
had shuffled in with the last of Charlie’s
“load” and he was cranking up his car. The latter
looked as though it had been through No
Man’s Land, clear to the Boche “ditches” it was
so battered and mud-bespattered. Charlie himself
had a bandage around his head which looked
like an Afghan’s turban.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear boy! Are you hurt?” Ruth
gasped, running down the steps to him.
</p>
<p>
“No,” grunted the young ambulance driver.
“Got this as an order of merit. For special bravery
in the performance of duty,” and he grinned.
“Gosh! I can’t get hurt proper. I bumped my
head on a beam in the park—pretty near cracked
my skull, now I tell you! Say! How’s your
friend?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
“That is exactly what I don’t know,” Ruth
hastened to tell him.
</p>
<p>
“How’s that? Didn’t you go to Lyse?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But the man in whose pocket that letter
to me was found isn’t Tom Cameron at all. It
was some one else!”
</p>
<p>
“What? You don’t mean it! Then how did
he come by that letter? I saw it taken out of the
poor chap’s pocket. Johnny Mall wrote the note
to you on the outside of it. I knew it was intended
for you, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“But the man isn’t Tom. I should say, Lieutenant
Thomas Cameron.”
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me I’ve heard of that fellow,” ruminated
the ambulance driver, removing his big
spectacles to wipe them. “But I believe he <em>is</em>
wounded. I’m sorry,” he added, as he saw the
change in Ruth’s face. “Maybe he isn’t, after
all. Is—is this chap a pretty close friend of
yours?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth told him, somewhat brokenly, in truth,
just how near and dear to her the Cameron twins
were. Telling more, perhaps, in the case of Tom,
than she intended.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see what I can find out about him. He’s
been in this sector, I believe,” he said. “I guess
he has been at our headquarters up yonder and
I’ve met him.
</p>
<p>
“Well, so long,” he added, hopping into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
car. “Next time I’m back this way maybe I’ll
have some news for you—<em>good</em> news.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope so!” murmured Ruth, watching
the battered ambulance wheel out of the hospital
court.
</p>
<p>
Henriette Dupay had an errand in the village
the next day and came to see Ruth, too. The
little French girl was very much excited.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear Mademoiselle Ruth!” she cried.
“What do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I could not possibly think—for <em>you</em>,” smiled
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“It is so—just as I told you,” wailed the other
girl. “It always happens.”
</p>
<p>
“Do tell me what you mean? What has happened
now?”
</p>
<p>
“Something bad always follows the seeing of
the werwolf. My grandmère says it is a curse on
the neighborhood because many of our people
neglect the church. Think!”
</p>
<p>
“Do tell me,” begged the American girl.
</p>
<p>
“Our best cow died,” cried Henriette. “Our—ve-ry—best—cow!
It is an affliction, Mademoiselle.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth could well understand that to be so, for
cows, since the German invasion, have been very
scarce in this part of France. Henriette was
quite confident that the appearance of the “werwolf”
had foretold the demise of “the poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
Lally.” The American girl saw that it was quite
useless to seek to change her little friend’s opinion
on that score.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, the thing we saw in the road could
not have been the countess’ dog?” she ventured.
</p>
<p>
But Henriette would have none of that. “Why,
Bubu’s blanket is black,” she cried. “And you
know the werwolf is all of a white color—and so
hu-u-uge!”
</p>
<p>
She would have nothing of the idea that Bubu
was the basis of the countryside superstition. But
the French girl had a second exciting bit of news.
</p>
<p>
“Think you!” she cried, “what I saw coming
over to town this ve-ry day, Mademoiselle
Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“Another mystery?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite so. But yes. You would never, as you
say, ‘guess.’ I passed old Bessie, Madame la
Countess’ serving woman, riding fast, <em>fast</em> in a
motor-car. Is it not a wonder?”
</p>
<p>
The statement startled Ruth, but she hid her
emotion, asking:
</p>
<p>
“Not alone—surely? You do not mean that
that old woman drives the countess’ car?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Mademoiselle. The countess has no
car. This was the strange car you and I saw on
the road that day—the one that was stalled in the
rut. You remember the tall capitaine—and the
little one?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
The shock of the French girl’s statement was
almost too much for Ruth’s self-control. Her
voice sounded husky in her own ears when she
asked:
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Henriette! Are you <em>sure</em>? The old
woman was riding away with those two men?”
</p>
<p>
“But yes, Mademoiselle. And they drive fast,
fast!” and she pointed east, away from the hospital,
and away from the road which led to
Lyse.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—A PARTIAL EXPOSURE</h2>
<p>
It was when Ruth was going off duty for the
day that the matron sent for her to come to the
office before going to her own cell, as the tiny
immaculate little rooms were called in which the
Red Cross workers slept.
</p>
<p>
Obeying the summons, Ruth crossed the wide
entrance hall and saw in the court a high-powered,
open touring car in which sat two military-appearing
men, although neither was in uniform.
In the matron’s room was another—a tall, dark
young man, who arose from his chair the instant
the girl entered the room.
</p>
<p>
“Monsieur Lafrane, Mademoiselle Fielding,”
said the matron nervously. “Monsieur Lafrane
is connected, he tells me, with the Department of
Justice.”
</p>
<p>
“With the secret police, Mademoiselle,” the
man said significantly. “The prefect of police at
Lyse has sent me to you,” and he bowed again to
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The matron was evidently somewhat alarmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
as well as surprised, but Ruth’s calm manner reassured
her to some extent.
</p>
<p>
“It is all right, Madame,” the American girl
told her. “I expected monsieur’s visit.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if mademoiselle is assured——?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite, Madame.”
</p>
<p>
The Frenchwoman hurried from the office and
left the girl and the secret agent alone. The latter
smiled quietly and asked Ruth to be seated.
</p>
<p>
“It is from Monsieur Joilette, at Lyse, that I
come, as I say. He informs me you have the
logic of a man—and a man’s courage, Mademoiselle.
He thinks highly of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he thinks too highly of my courage,”
Ruth returned, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Not so,” proceeded Monsieur Lafrane, with
rather a stern countenance, “for it must take some
courage to tell but half your story when first you
went to Monsieur Joilette. It is not—er—exactly
safe to tell half truths to the French police, Mademoiselle.”
</p>
<p>
“Not if one is an American?” smiled Ruth, not
at all shaken. “Nor did I consider that I did
wrong in saying nothing about Mrs. Mantel at
the time, when I had nothing but suspicion against
her. If Monsieur Joilette is as wise as I think
him, he could easily have found the connection
between those two dishonest men from America
and the lady.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“True. And he did so,” said the secret agent,
nodding emphatically. “But already Legrand and
this José had made what you Americans would
call ‘a killing,’ yes?” Ruth nodded, smiling.
“They got away with the money. But we are
not allowing Madame Mantel, as she calls herself——”
</p>
<p>
“That isn’t her name then?”
</p>
<p>
“Name of a name!” ejaculated the man in disgust.
“I should say not. She is Rosa Bonnet,
who married an American crook four years ago
and went to the United States. He was shot, I
understand, in an attempt of his gang to rob a
bank in one of your Western States.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! And she came East and entered into our
Red Cross work. How dreadful!”
</p>
<p>
“Rosa is a sharp woman. We believe she has
done work for <em>les Boches</em>. But then,” he added,
“we believe that of every crook we capture now.”
</p>
<p>
“And is she arrested?”
</p>
<p>
“But yes, Mademoiselle,” he said good-naturedly.
“At least the police of Lyse were about
to gather her in as I left this afternoon to come
over here. But the men——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Monsieur!” cried Ruth, with clasped
hands, “they have been in this neighborhood only
to-day.”
</p>
<p>
He shot in a quick: “How do you know that,
Mademoiselle Fielding?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
She told him of the French girl’s visit and of
what Henriette had said of seeing Legrand, the
Mexican and Bessie riding away in a motor-car
from the chateau.
</p>
<p>
“To be trusted, this girl? This Mademoiselle
Dupay?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, quite!”
</p>
<p>
“The scoundrels! They slip through our fingers
at every turn. But we will have them yet.
Surely they cannot escape us for long. There are
too many looking for them—both of the secret
police and of the army.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the woman, too! The old woman and
that José may only be related. Perhaps she has
nothing to do with—with——”
</p>
<p>
“With what, Mademoiselle?” he asked, smiling
across the table at her, and that grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Is there not spying, too? Don’t you think
these people are in communication with the Germans?”
</p>
<p>
“Could you expect me to answer that query,
Mademoiselle?” he returned, his eyes suddenly
twinkling. “But, yes! I see you are vitally interested.
And you have heard this old wives’ tale
of the werwolf.”
</p>
<p>
He quite startled her then, for she had said
nothing of that in her letter to the Lyse prefect
of police.
</p>
<p>
“Some matters must be cleared up. You may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
be able to help, Mademoiselle. I have come to
ask you to make a call with me.”
</p>
<p>
“A call? On the Dupays? I hope I have said
nothing to lead you to suppose that they are not
loyal. And they have been kind to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite so, Mademoiselle,” he rejoined again
with gravity. “I would ask you to do nothing
that will make you feel an atom of disgrace. No,
no! A mere call—and you shall return here in
an hour.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew it was a command as well as a request.
She hurried for her wrap, for the evening
was damp. But she did not remove her costume
of the Red Cross.
</p>
<p>
As she came down to the waiting car she saw
that she was peered at by several of the nurses.
Some wind of what was going on evidently had
got about the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Ruth ran down the steps and jumped into the
car, the tonneau door of which was held open by
the man with whom she had talked in the matron’s
office. Instantly the engine began to purr and the
car slipped away from the steps.
</p>
<p>
Lafrane bowed to Ruth again, and said, with a
gesture, as though introducing her:
</p>
<p>
“My comrades, Mademoiselle Fielding. Be
of good courage. Like myself, Mademoiselle,
they admire the courage of <em>les Americaines</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth could say nothing to that. She felt half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
stifled with seething emotions. Her heart beat
rapidly. What was now going to happen to her?
She had endured many strange experiences since
coming to France; but she had to admit that she
was not prepared for this occurrence.
</p>
<p>
The car shot through the tortuous roads
swiftly. Suddenly she noted that they were taking
the hilly road to the Dupay farm—the longer
way. They mounted the hill toward the chateau
gate.
</p>
<p>
A light flashed ahead in the roadway. The car
was pulled down to a stop before the entrance to
the Chateau Marchand. Another soldierly looking
man—this one in uniform—held the lantern
and pointed to the gateway of the estate. To
Ruth’s surprise the wide gates were open.
</p>
<p>
The guard said something swiftly that the girl
did not catch. The chauffeur manipulated the
clutch and again the car leaped ahead. It turned
directly into the private drive leading up to the
chateau.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—Quite Satisfactory</h2>
<p>
Ruth said nothing to Monsieur Lafrane, although
she was startled. He had had no idea,
then, of taking her to the Dupay farm. She was
somewhat relieved by this discovery, although she
was curious as to why she was being carried to
the chateau.
</p>
<p>
It was plain that their visit was expected. The
great front door of the old pile of masonry was
wide open and a flaring, swinging lamp illuminated
the entrance hall, the light shining far
across the flagging before the door. As the girl
had noted, there seemed no fear here at the
chateau of German night raiders, while the village
of Clair lay like a black swamp below the
hill, not a lamp, even in the hospital, being allowed
to shine from windows or doorways there.
</p>
<p>
“Will you come in, Mademoiselle?” said the
leader of the expedition softly.
</p>
<p>
One of his companions got out, too, and him
they left in the entrance hall, standing grim and
silent against the wall like an added piece of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
ancient armor, of which there were several in
sight, while the secret agent and Ruth entered an
apartment on the right.
</p>
<p>
It was a library—a long and lofty room, paneled
with carved oak and furnished in a wood
quite as dark, the chairs and huge table being
massive. There were a few fine old pictures; but
the bookshelves were almost stripped of volumes.
Ruth noted that but a few dozen remained.
</p>
<p>
The floor, too, was bare; yet by the stain on
the boards she saw that once a huge rug must
have almost covered the room. Everything remaining
gave the apartment a stern and poverty-stricken
air.
</p>
<p>
These things she noted at first glance. The
countess was present, and it was the countess who
attracted Ruth’s almost immediate attention.
</p>
<p>
She was quite as handsome and graceful as she
had seemed when Ruth saw her walking in the
road. But now she was angry, and her head was
held high and her cheeks were deeply flushed.
Her scant skirts swishing in and out of the candlelight,
she walked up and down the room beyond
the table, with something of the litheness of the
caged tiger.
</p>
<p>
“And have you come back to repeat these
things you have said about Bessie?” she demanded
in French of the secret agent.
</p>
<p>
“But, yes, Madame la Countess. It is necessary that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
you be convinced,” he said respectfully.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot believe it. I resent your accusation
of poor Bessie. She has been with me for twenty
years.”
</p>
<p>
“It is so,” said the man gravely. “And we
cast no reflection upon her faithfulness to you,
Madame. But have you noted no change in her—of
late?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, who has not been changed by the war?”
murmured the countess, stopping to look at them
across the table. Then for the first time she
seemed to apprehend Ruth’s presence. She
bowed distantly. “Mademoiselle Americaine,”
she murmured. “What is this?”
</p>
<p>
“I would ask the mademoiselle to tell you what
she knows of the connection of your servant with
these men we are after,” said the secret agent
briefly. Then he gestured for Ruth to speak.
</p>
<p>
The latter understood now what she had been
brought here for. And she was shrewd enough
to see, too, that the French secret police thought
the countess entirely trustworthy.
</p>
<p>
Therefore Ruth began at the beginning and
told of her suspicions aroused against Legrand
and José when still she was in America, and of
all the events which linked them to some plot,
aimed against France, although she, of course, did
not know and was not likely to know what that
plot was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
The men were proven crooks. They were in
disguise. And Ruth was positive that José was
closely associated with the old serving woman
whom Ruth had seen with the dog.
</p>
<p>
At mention of the greyhound the countess and
the secret agent exchanged glances. Ruth intercepted
them; but she made no comment. She saw
well enough that there was a secret in that which
she was not to know.
</p>
<p>
Nor did she ever expect to learn anything more
about that phase of the matter, being unblessed
with second sight. However, in our next volume,
“Ruth Fielding at the War Front; Or, The Hunt
for a Lost Soldier,” she was destined to gain much
information on several points connected with the
old chateau and its occupants.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, she merely told the countess
what the agent had asked her to tell, including the
fact that Bessie had been seen that afternoon riding
away from the chateau with the two criminals,
Legrand and José.
</p>
<p>
Her testimony seemed to convince the lady of
the chateau. She bowed her head and wiped
away the tears that moistened her now paling
cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Ma foi!</em> Who, then, is to be trusted?” she
murmured, when the girl had finished. “Your
pardon, Monsieur! But, remember, I have had
the poor creature in my service for many years.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“I must accept all your story as true. The
American mademoiselle convinces me. This José,
then, must be Bessie’s nephew. I had heard of
him. I must thank her, perhaps, that she did not
allow him and his associate to rob me before she
ran away. The apaches!”
</p>
<p>
“We will get them,” said the agent cheerfully,
preparing to depart. “I leave men in the neighborhood.
They will communicate with you—and
you can trust them. If the woman reappears
alone we must question her. You understand?”
and he spoke with some sternness.
</p>
<p>
The countess nodded, having recovered her
self-control. “I know my duty, Monsieur,” she
said. Then to Ruth, putting forth her hand, she
added:
</p>
<p>
“You have called and find me in sore trouble,
my dear. Do I understand that you work in our
hospital at Clair?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Madame,” replied the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Come to see me again, then—at a happier
time.” She pressed Ruth’s hand for a moment
and went out. The secret service agent bowed
low as she disappeared. Then he said with admiration
to Ruth:
</p>
<p>
“<em>Ma foi!</em> A countess, say you? She should be
a queen.” Ah, this good republican was quite
plainly a lover of the aristocracy, too!
</p>
<p>
Ruth was whisked back to the hospital. On
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
the way Monsieur Lafrane assured her that she
would be gratefully remembered by the French
secret police for what seemed to her, after all, a
very simple thing.
</p>
<p>
The men were confident of soon apprehending
Legrand and his companions. “And then—the
jug!” ejaculated the leader, using with gusto what
he fondly believed to be another Americanism.
</p>
<p>
It was not likely that Ruth would sleep much
that night. Her mind was greatly overwrought.
But finally, about daylight, when she did fall into
a more or less refreshing sleep, an orderly came
to her door and knocked until she responded.
</p>
<p>
“Mademoiselle has waiting for her on the steps
a visitor,” he said, with a chuckle. “She should
come down at once.”
</p>
<p>
“A visitor, Henri?” she cried. “Who can it
be?”
</p>
<p>
“One young <em>Americaine</em>,” he replied, and went
away cheerfully humming a tune.
</p>
<p>
“What can that Charlie Bragg want at this
hour in the morning?” Ruth murmured, yet hurrying
her toilet. “Possibly he brings news of
Tom!”
</p>
<p>
Down she ran to the court as soon as she was
neat. A man was sitting on the steps, leaning
against the doorpost. It was not Charlie, for he
was in military uniform and she could see an
officer’s insignia. He was asleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
She saw as she left the stairway and crossed
the entrance hall that he wore his arm in a sling.
She thought instantly of the unknown American
in Lyse Hospital who had lost his forearm.
Then——
</p>
<p>
“Tom Cameron!” she cried, and sprang to his
side.
</p>
<p>
The soldier awoke with a start. He looked up
at her and grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo, Ruthie,” he observed. “Excuse this
early call, but I might not have another rest day
for a long time. We’re going into the trenches—going
to take over a sector of the French line,
they say, before long. So——
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! What’s happened?”
</p>
<p>
“Your arm, Tom! You are wounded?” she
gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shucks! Got a splinter of shell in it.
Nothing much. Keeping it in splints so it will
mend quicker,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“But your letter, Tom!” she cried, and there,
in the early morning, standing upon the hospital
steps, she told him the story of the happening that
had so disturbed and troubled her.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t that beat all!” exclaimed Tom. “I
wondered what had happened to that letter that
I had just finished when I was called on duty. It
was Sam Hines who had his arm torn off—poor
fellow. We heard from him. He’s getting on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
all right, but, of course, he’ll have to go home.
</p>
<p>
“He must have picked up my letter, maybe to
give it to me, knowing I had forgotten it. Well,
it’s all right, Ruthie. I can tell you lots more
than was in that letter—and you’ve got a lot to
tell me.”
</p>
<p>
So they sat down, side by side, and related
each to the other all their adventures, while the
great guns on the battle line boomed a rumbling
accompaniment to what was said.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
