description: Ruth, Helen, and Jennie "Heavy" Stone attend Ardmore College together.
  Ruth continues to write moving picture scenarios and achieves even greater success.
  The girls leave college when the Great War begins and travel to Europe to help with
  the war effort. In time, the war ends, and Jennie Stone marries a French soldier.
  Tom Cameron suggests that he and Ruth make plans for their future, but Ruth wants
  a career and feels that marriage would be an obstacle. Ruth also feels that Tom
  is lazy and wants him to prove himself before they make a commitment.
